Explanation:
Advising on Repair
On the "View and Manage Failures" page, the Data Recovery Advisor generates a manual
checklist after you click the Advise button. Two types of failures can appear.
? Failures that require human intervention: An example is a connectivity failure when a disk cable
is not plugged in.
? Failures that are repaired faster if you can undo a previous erroneous action: For example, if you
Oracle 1z0-052 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 14
renamed a data file by error, it is faster to rename it back to its previous name than to initiate
RMAN restoration from backup.
You can initiate the following actions:
? Click "Re-assess Failures" after you perform a manual repair. Resolved failures are implicitly
closed; any remaining failures are displayed on the "View and Manage Failures" page.
? Click "Continue with Advise" to initiate an automated repair. When the Data Recovery Advisor
generates an automated repair option, it generates a script that shows how RMAN plans to repair
the failure. Click Continue if you want to execute the automated repair. If you do not want the Data
Recovery Advisor to automatically repair the failure, you can use this script as a starting point for
your manual repair.

You have two tables with referential integrity enforced between them. You need to insert data to

available in a later stage, which can be inserted as part of the same transaction.
View the Exhibit to examine the commands used to create tables.
Which action would you take to delay the referential integrity checking until the end of the
transaction?

A. Set the constraint to deferred before starting the transaction
B. Alter the constraint to NOVALIDATE state before starting the transaction
C. Enable the resumable mode for the session before starting the transaction
D. Set the COMMIT_WAIT parameter to FORCE_WAIT for the session before starting the
transaction
Answer: A
Explanation:
Specifying Constraint State
As part of constraint definition, you can specify how and when Oracle should enforce the
constraint.
constraint_state You can use the constraint_state with both inline and out-of-line specification. You
can specify the clauses of constraint_state in any order, but you can specify each clause only
once.
DEFERRABLE Clause The DEFERRABLE and NOT DEFERRABLE parameters indicate whether
or not, in subsequent transactions, constraint checking can be deferred until the end of the
transaction using the SET CONSTRAINT(S) statement. If you omit this clause, then the default is
NOT DEFERRABLE.
Specify NOT DEFERRABLE to indicate that in subsequent transactions you cannot use the SET
CONSTRAINT[S] clause to defer checking of this constraint until the transaction is committed. The
checking of a NOT DEFERRABLE constraint can never be deferred to the end of the transaction.
If you declare a new constraint NOT DEFERRABLE, then it must be valid at the time the CREATE
TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement is committed or the statement will fail.
Specify DEFERRABLE to indicate that in subsequent transactions you can use the SET
CONSTRAINT[S] clause to defer checking of this constraint until after the transaction is
committed. This setting in effect lets you disable the constraint temporarily while making changes
to the database that might violate the constraint until all the changes are complete.
You cannot alter the deferability of a constraint. That is, whether you specify either of these
parameters, or make the constraint NOT DEFERRABLE implicitly by specifying neither of them,
you cannot specify this clause in an ALTER TABLE statement. You must drop the constraint and
re-create it.

backup-level
Description
The backup-level placeholder specifies the level of a backup created with the backup command.
Syntax
backup-level::=
full | incr_level | incr | offsite
incr_level::=
1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
Semantics
full
Specifies that Oracle Secure Backup should back up all files defined in a dataset regardless of
when they were last backed up. This option is equivalent to level 0. This is the default value.
incr_level
Specifies an incremental level from 1 to 9 and backs up only those files that have changed since
the last backup at a lower level.
incr
Specifies that Oracle Secure Backup should back up any file that has been modified since the last
incremental backup at the same level or lower. The incr option is equivalent to level 10. This level
is platform dependent and is incompatible with some client operating systems such as the Netapp
filer's Data ONTAP.
offsite
Equivalent to a full (level 0) backup except that Oracle Secure Backup keeps a record of this
backup in such a way that it does not affect the full or incremental backup schedule. This option is
useful when you want to create a backup image for offsite storage without disturbing your
schedule of incremental backups.

View the Exhibit and examine the undo tablespace attributes. Your database instance is
experiencing a large volume of transactions from non-DBA users in the last one hour. The undo

C. The undo data generated by the DML will overwrite the extents that contain committed undo
data
D. The undo data generated by the DML is stored in the SYSTEM undo segment of the SYSTEM
tablespace
Answer: A
Explanation:
Tablespaces in the Preconfigured Database (continued)
? TEMP: Your temporary tablespace is used when you execute a SQL statement that requires the
creation of temporary segments (such as a large sort or the creation of an index). Just as each
user is assigned a default tablespace for storing created data objects, each user is assigned a
temporary tablespace. The best practice is to define a default temporary tablespace for the
Oracle 1z0-052 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 48
database, which is assigned to all newly created users unless otherwise specified. In the
preconfigured database, the TEMP tablespace is specified as the default temporary tablespace.
This means that if no temporary tablespace is specified when the user account is created. Oracle
Database assigns this tablespace to the user.
? UNDOTBS1: This is the undo tablespace used by the database server to store undo information.
If a database uses Automatic Undo Management, it must have exactly one active undo tablespace
per instance at any given time. This tablespace is created at database creation time.
? USERS: This tablespace is used to store permanent user objects and data. In the preconfigured
database, the USERS tablespace is the default tablespace for all objects created by nonsystem
users. For the SYS and SYSTEM users (the system users), the default permanent tablespace
remains SYSTEM.

You configured the Flash Recovery Area for your database. The database instance has been
started in ARCHIVELOG mode and the LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_1 parameter is not set.
What will be the implications on the archiving and the location of archive redo log files?
A. Archiving will be disabled because the destination for the redo log files is missing
B. The database instance will shut down and the error details will be logged in the alert log file
C. Archiving will be enabled and the destination for the archived redo log file will be set to the
Flash Recovery Area implicitly
D. Archiving will be enabled and the location for the archive redo log file will be created in the
default location $ORACLE_HOME/log
Answer: C
Explanation: LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_n
The LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_n parameters (where n = 1, 2, 3, ... 10) define up to ten archive log
destinations.
The parameter integer suffix is defined as the handle displayed by the V$ARCHIVE_DEST
dynamic performance view.
Values:
SERVICE
Specifies a standby destination. Oracle Net (IPC or TCP) transmits the archivelog. A standby
instance must be associated with the destination. The value represented by tnsnames_service
corresponds to an appropriate service name in tnsnames.ora.
LOCATION
Specifies a local file system destination. You must specify this parameter for at least one
destination.
MANDATORY
Specifies that archiving to the destination must succeed before the redo log file can be made
available for reuse.
OPTIONAL
Specifies that successful archiving to the destination is not required before the redo log file can be
made available for reuse. If the "must succeed count," set with
LOG_ARCHIVE_MIN_SUCCEED_DEST, is met, the redo logfile is marked for reuse. This is the
default.
Oracle 1z0-052 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 51
REOPEN
Specifies the minimum number of seconds before the archiver process (ARCn, foreground, or log
writer process) should try again to access a previously failed destination. Future attempts are
made when the next redo log file is archived. If a destination is MANDATORY, then Oracle
recommends that you specify a REOPEN time that reduces the possibility of primary database
shutdown due to lack of available online redo log files.
If you do not specify seconds, then the default value is 300

You are working on an instance started using the SPFILE. You want to move the Flash Recovery
Area of your database to a new location. You want the Flashback log files to be stored in the new
location. Given below are the steps to accomplish the task in random order:
1) Shut down the instance.
Oracle 1z0-052 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 56
2) Change the value of the DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST initialization parameter to a new value.
3) Execute the ALTER DATABASE FLASHBACK OFF command.
4) Start up the instance and mount the database.
5) Execute the ALTER DATABASE FLASHBACK ON command.
6) Open the database.
Select the correct order in which these tasks need to be performed.
A. 2, 1, 4, 3, 5, 6
B. 1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5
C. 1, 4, 2, 6, 3, 5
D. 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6
Answer: A
Explanation:
How to change Flash Recovery Area to a new location?
If you need to move the Flash Recovery Area of your database to a new location, invoke
SQL*Plus to change the DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST initialization parameter.
For example:
ALTER SYSTEM SET DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST='+disk1' SCOPE=BOTH SID='*';
After you change this parameter, all new Flash Recovery Area files will be created in the new
location.
The permanent files (control files and online redolog files), flashback logs and transient files can
be left in the old Flash Recovery Area location. The database will delete the transient files from the
old Flash Recovery Area location as they become eligible for deletion.
For the FLASHBACK logfiles to be able to to pick up the new 'db_recovery_file_dest' location, the
flashback option needs to be toggled off and on.
This can be done like this:
- Shutdown the Database
- Startup mount the Database:
SQL> startup mount;
- Toggle the Flashback off:
SQL> alter database flashback off;
- Toggle the Flashback on:
SQL> alter database flashback on;
- Open the Database:
Oracle 1z0-052 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 57
SQL> alter database open;
If you need to actually move your current permanent files, transient files, to the new Flash
Recovery Area, then follow the following steps:
1) To move the existing backupsets and archived redo log files, use the following command:
RMAN> BACKUP AS COPY ARCHIVELOG ALL DELETE INPUT;
RMAN> BACKUP DEVICE TYPE DISK BACKUPSET ALL DELETE INPUT;

A. The database instance is running with manual PGA management.
B. The database instance is running with manual shared memory management.
C. The database instance has the MEMORY_TARGET value set to a nonzero value.
D. All sessions are connected to the database instance in dedicated mode, and no RMAN or
parallel query operations have been performed.
Answer: C
Explanation:
Oracle 1z0-052 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 59
MEMORY_TARGET specifies the Oracle system-wide usable memory. The database tunes
memory to the MEMORY_TARGET value, reducing or enlarging the SGA and PGA as needed.
In a text-based initialization parameter file, if you omit MEMORY_MAX_TARGET and include a
value for MEMORY_TARGET, then the database automatically sets MEMORY_MAX_TARGET to
the value of MEMORY_TARGET. If you omit the line for MEMORY_TARGET and include a value
for MEMORY_MAX_TARGET, the MEMORY_TARGET parameter defaults to zero. After startup,
you can then dynamically change MEMORY_TARGET to a nonzero value, provided that it does
not exceed the value of MEMORY_MAX_TARGET.
QUESTION NO: 105
Your database instance is started using the server parameter file (SPFILE). You executed a

You have executed this command to change the size of the database buffer cache:

System altered.
To verify the change in size, you executed this command:
Why is the value set to 4194304 and not to 2516582?
A. Because 4194304 is the granule size
B. Because 4194304 is the standard block size
C. Because 4194304 is the largest nonstandard block size defined in the database
D. Because 4194304 is the total size of data already available in the database buffer cache
Answer: A
Explanation:
Regardless of whether you are using automatic or manual memory management, you'll find that
memory is allocated to the various pools in the SGA in units called granules. A single granule is an
Oracle 1z0-052 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 63
area of memory of 4MB, 8MB, or 16MB in size. The granule is the smallest unit of allocation, so if
you ask for a lava pool of 5MB and your granule size is 4MB. Oracle will actually allocate 8MB to
the lava pool (8 being the smallest number greater than or equal to 5 that is a multiple of the
granule size of 4). The size of a granule is determined by the size of your SGA (this sounds
recursive to a degree, as the size of the SGA is dependent on the granule size). Vim can view the
granule sizes used for each pool by querying V$SGA_DYNAMIC_COMPONENTS. In fact, we can
use this view to see how the total SGA size might affect the size of the granules:

Database Block: Contents
? Block header: The block header contains the segment type (such as table or index), data block
address, table directory, row directory, and transaction slots of size 24 bytes each, which are used
when modifications are made to rows in the block. The block header grows downward from the
top.
? Row data: This is the actual data for the rows in the block. Row data space grows upward from
the bottom.
? Free space: Free space is in the middle of the block, enabling the header and the row data
space to grow when necessary. Row data takes up free space as new rows are inserted or as
columns of existing rows are updated with larger values.
Examples of events that cause header growth:
- Row directories that need more row entries
- More transaction slots required than initially configured
Initially, the free space in a block is contiguous. However, deletions and updates may fragment the
free space in the block. The free space in the block is coalesced by the Oracle server when
necessary.

B. It cannot invoke subprograms defined in other packages.
C. It can contain only the subprograms defined in the package specification.
D. It can be changed and recompiled without making the package specification invalid.
Answer: A,D
Explanation:
Package Specification and Body
Package bodies:
? Are separate from package specifications. Because of this, the code of the body can be changed
and recompiled, and other objects that are dependent on the specification are not marked invalid.
? Contain the code for subprograms defined in the package specification. This is where the work is
done. The specification shows how to call subprograms within the package: the body is the code
section
? Cannot be compiled unless the package specification has already been compiled. You can
create a specification without a body- but you cannot create a body without a specification.
? May be wrapped to hide details of the code. Wrap is a stand-alone program that obfuscates PL
SQL source code so that you can deliver PL SQL applications without exposing your source code.

A constraint in a table is defined with the INITIALLY IMMEDIATE clause. You executed the
ALTER TABLE command with the ENABLE VALIDATE option to enable the constraint that was

What are the two effects of this command? (Choose two.)
A. It fails if any existing row violates the constraint.
B. It does not validate the existing data in the table.
C. It enables the constraint to be enforced at the end of each transaction.
D. It prevents insert, update, and delete operations on the table while the constraint is in the
process of being enabled.
Answer: A,D
Explanation:
Deferred constraints are constraints that are checked only when a transaction is committed. If
constraint violations are detected at commit time, the entire transaction is rolled back. These
constraints are most useful when both the parent and child rows in a foreign key relationship are
entered at the same tune, as in the case of an order entry system in which the order and the items
in the order are entered at the same time. For deferrable constraints, primary key and unique keys
need non-unique indexes; if the column or columns already have a unique index on them,
constraint creation fails because those indexes cannot be deferred.
Constraint Checking (continued)
A constraint that is defined as deferrable can be specified as one of the following:
? Initially immediate specifies that by default it must function as an immediate constraint unless
explicitly set otherwise.
? Initially deferred specifies that by default the constraint must be enforced only at the end of the
transaction.
Note: If an appropriate index already exists on the column, it is used for the constraint. An
additional index does not need to be created for primary keys and unique keys.

Which two activities are NOT supported by the Data Recovery Advisor (DRA)? (Choose two.)
A. Recover from failures in the RAC environment.
B. Diagnose and repair a data file corruption online.
C. Diagnose and repair a data file corruption offline.
D. Diagnose and repair failures on a standby database.
Answer: A,D
Explanation:
Data Recovery Advisor
The Data Recovery Advisor automatically gathers data failure information when an error is
encountered. In addition, it can proactively check for failures. In this mode, it can potentially detect
and analyze data failures before a database process discovers the corruption and signals an error.
(Note that repairs are always under human control.)
Data failures can be very serious. For example, if your current los files are missing, you cannot
open your database. Some data failures (like block corruptions in data files) are not catastrophic
because they do not take the database down or prevent you from opening the Oracle instance.
The Data Recovery Advisor handles both cases: the one when you cannot start up the database
(because required database files are missing, inconsistent, or corrupted) and the one when file
corruptions are discovered during run time.
Supported Database Configurations
In the current release, the Data Recovery Advisor supports single-instance databases. Oracle
Real Application Clusters databases are not supported.
Oracle 1z0-052 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 80
The Data Recovery Advisor cannot use blocks or files transferred from a standby database to
repair failures on a primary database. Furthermore, you cannot use the Data Recovery Advisor to
diagnose and repair failure on a standby database. However, the Data Recovery Advisor does
support failover to a standby database as a repair option (as mentioned above).

tasks, for example:
* Issuing alerts whenever a given metrics violates its threshold value
* Taking snapshots by spawning additional process (MMOX slaves)
* Capturing statistics value for SQL objects that have been recently modified
The Lightweight Manageability Monitor process (MMXL) performs frequent tasks related to
lightweight manageability, such as session history capture and metrics computation.
The Memory Manager process (MMAN) is used for internal database tasks. It manages automatic
memory management processing to help allocate memory where it is needed dynamically in an
effort to avoid out-of-memory conditions or poor buffer cache performance.

Which two statements are true regarding transactions in an Oracle database? (Choose two.)
A. Multiple transactions can use the same undo segment.
B. A transaction is assigned an undo segment when it is started.
C. More than one transaction cannot share the same extent in the undo tablespace.
D. The transactions use system undo segment to store undo data if all the segments in the undo
tablespace are used.
Answer: A,B
Explanation:
Segments
Oracle 1z0-052 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 83
The level of logical database storage above an extent is called a segment. A segment is a set of
extents that are allocated for a certain logical structure. Different types of segments include:
? Data segments: Each nonclustered. non-index-organized table has a data segment, with the
exception of external tables, global temporary tables, and partitioned tables in which each table
has one or more segments. All of the table's data is stored in the extents of its data segment. For
a partitioned table, each partition has a data segment. Each cluster has a data segment. The data
of every table in the cluster is stored in the cluster's data segment.
? Index segments: Each index has an index segment that stores all of its data. For a partitioned
index, each partition has an index segment.
? Undo segments: One UNDO tablespace is created for each database instance. This tablespace
contains numerous undo segments to temporarily store undo information. The information in an
undo segment is used to generate read-consistent database information and. dining database
recovery, to roll back uncommitted transactions for users.
? Temporary segments: Temporary segments are created by the Oracle database when a SQL
statement needs a temporary work area to complete execution. When the statement finishes
execution, the temporary segment's extents are returned to the instance for future use. Specify
either a default temporary tablespace for every user, or a default temporary tablespace that is
used database-wide.
Transactions and Undo Data
When a transaction starts, it is assigned to an undo segment. Throughout the life of the
transaction, when data is changed, the original (before the change) values are copied into the
undo segment. You can see which transactions are assigned to which undo segments by checking
the V$TRANSACTION dynamic performance view.
Undo segments are specialized segments that are automatically created by the instance as
needed to support transactions. Like all segments, undo segments are made up of extents, which,
in turn, consist of data blocks. Undo segments automatically grow and shrink as needed, acting as
a circular storage buffer for their assigned transactions.
Transactions fill extents in their undo segments until a transaction is completed or all space is
consumed. If an extent fills up and more space is needed, the transaction acquires that space
from the next extent in the segment. After all extents have been consumed, the transaction either
wraps around back into the first extent or requests a new extent to be allocated to the undo
segment.

Which two statements are true regarding B-tree index? (Choose two.)
A. The leaf blocks in the index are doubly linked.
B. The leaf node stores a bitmap for each key value.
C. The rows with NULL value in key columns also have entries in the index.
D. The deletion of a row from the table causes a logical deletion in index leaf block and the space
becomes available for the new leaf entry.
Answer: A,D
Explanation:
B-Tree Index
Structure of a B-tree Index
At the top of the index is the root, which contains entries that point to the next level in the index. At
the next level are branch blocks, which in turn point to blocks at the next level in the index. At the
lowest level are the leaf nodes, which contain the index entries that point to rows in the table. The
leaf blocks are doubly linked to facilitate the scanning of the index in an ascending as well as
descending order of key values.
Format of Index Leaf Entries
An index entry has the following components:
? Entry header: Stores the number of columns and locking information
? Key column length-value pairs: Define the size of a column in the key followed by the value for
the column (The number of such pairs is the maximum of the number of columns in the index.)
? ROWID: Row ID of a row that contains the key values
B-Tree Index (continued)
Index Leaf Entry Characteristics
In a B-tree index on a nonpartitioned table:
? Key values are repeated if there are multiple rows that have the same key value unless the index
is compressed
? There is no index entry corresponding to a row that has all key columns that are NULL.
Therefore, a WHERE clause specifying NULL always results in a full table scan.
? A restricted ROWID is used to point to the rows of the table because all rows belong to the same
segment
Effect of DML Operations on an Index
The Oracle server maintains all the indexes when DML operations are carried out on a table. Here
is an explanation of the effect of a DML command on an index:
Oracle 1z0-052 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 86
? Insert operations result in the insertion of an index entry in the appropriate block.
? Deleting a row results only in a logical deletion of the index entry. The space used by the deleted
row is available for new sequential leaf entries.
? Updates to the key columns result in a logical delete and an insert to the index. The PCTFREE
setting has no effect on the index except at the time of creation. A new entry may be added to an
index block even if it has less space than that specified by PCTFREE.
C:\Documents and Settings\RraAsShHiIdD\Desktop\untitled.JPG
Types of Indexes
These are several types of index structures that are available depending on your needs. Two of
the most common are:
? B-tree index
- Default index type; in the form of a balanced tree
? Bitmap index:
- Has a bitmap for each distinct value indexed
- Each bit position represents a row that may or may not contain the indexed value.
- Best for low-cardinality columns

D. The total number of client connections handled so far by the service handler is two.
Answer: B,D
Explanation:
Database Service Registration
For a listener to forward client connections to an instance, the listener must know the name of the
instance and where the instance's ORACLE_HOME is located. The listener can find this
information in two ways:
? Dynamic service registration: Oracle8i and later instances automatically register with the default
listener on database startup. No additional listener configuration is required for the default listener.
? Static service registration: Earlier releases of the Oracle database do not automatically register
with the listener and, therefore, require that the listener configuration file contain a list of all
database services that the listener will serve. You may still choose to use static service registration
with newer releases if:
- Your listener is not on the default port of 1521, and you do not want to configure your instance to
register with a nondefault port
- Your application requires static service registration

C. Grant the CREATE ANY TABLE privilege to SCOTT.
D. Increase the space for SCOTT on the USERS tablespace.
E. Increase the size of the data file associated with the USERS tablespace.
Answer: B,E
Explanation:
The Oracle docs note this on the ora-01653 error:

Oracle MOSC Documents offer great resources on resolving ORA-01653, namely the nature of
the problem as it relates to space availability:
------------
This error does not necessarily indicate whether or not you have enough space in the tablespace,
it merely indicates that Oracle could not find a large enough area of free contiguous space in

DBA_FREE_SPACE. Within this view, each record represents one fragment of space. How the
view DBA_FREE_SPACE can be used to determine the space available in the database is
described in Note 121259.1 Using DBA_FREE_SPACE

Constraint States (continued)
DISABLE NOVALIDATE: New as well as existing data may not conform to the constraint
because it is not checked. This is often used when the data is from an already validated source
and the table is read-only, so no new data is being entered into the table. NOVALIDATE is used in
data warehousing situations where the data has already been cleaned up. No validation is
needed, thereby saving time.
DISABLE VALIDATE: If a constraint is in this state, modification of the constrained columns is not
allowed because it would be inconsistent to validate the existing data and then allow unchecked
data to enter the table. This is often used when existing data must be validated but not modified
and when the index is not otherwise needed for performance.
ENABLE NOVALIDATE: New data conforms to the constraint, but existing data is in an unknown
state. This is frequently used when it is known that clean and conforming data exists in the table
so there is no need for validation. However, new violations are not allowed to enter the system.
ENABLE VALIDATE: Both new and existing data conform to the constraint. This is the typical and
default state of a constraint.

Explanation:
Altering a Tablespace (continued)
? Offline: You can take an online tablespace offline so that this portion of the database is
temporarily unavailable for general use. The rest of the database is open and available for users to
access data. When you take it offline, you can use the following options:
- Normal: A tablespace can be taken offline normally if no error conditions exist for any of the data
files of the tablespace. Oracle Database ensures that all data is written to disk by taking a
checkpoint for all data files of the tablespace as it Takes Them offline.
- Temporary: A tablespace can be taken offline temporarily even if there are error conditions for
one or more files of the tablespace. Oracle Database takes the data files (which are not already
offline) offline, performing checkpointing on them as it does so. If no files are offline, but you use
the Temporary clause, media recovery is not required to bring the tablespace back online.
However, if one or more files of the tablespace are offline because of write errors, and you take
the tablespace offline temporarily, the tablespace requires recovery before you can bring it back
online.
- Immediate: A tablespace can be taken offline immediately without Oracle Database taking a
checkpoint on any of the data files. When yon specify Immediate, media recovery for the
tablespace is required before the tablespace can be brought online. You cannot take a tablespace
offline immediately if the database is running in NOARCHIVELOG mode.
- For Recover: The FOR RECOVER setting has been deprecated. The syntax is supported for
backward compatibility.

C. The threshold alerts conditions are cleared and the alerts are transferred to
BA_ALERT_HISTORY.
D. The threshold alerts related to database metrics are permanently stored in
DBA_ALERT_HISTORY but not the threshold alerts related to instance metrics.
Answer: C
Explanation:
Alert Types and Clearing Alerts
There are two kinds of server-generated alerts: threshold and nonthreshold.
Most server-generated alerts are configured by setting a warning and critical threshold values on
database metrics. You can define thresholds for more than 120 metrics, including the following:
? Physical Reads Per Sec
? User Commits Per Sec
? SQL Service Response Time
Except for the Tablespace Space Usage metric, which is database related, the other metrics are
instance related. Threshold alerts are also referred to as stateful alerts, which are automatically
cleared when an alert condition clears. Stateful alerts appear in DBA_OUTSTANDING_ALERTS
and. when cleared, go to DBA_ALERT_HISTORY.
Other server-generated alerts correspond to specific database events such as ORA- * errors,
"Snapshot too old" errors, Recovery Area Low On Free Space, and Resumable Session
Suspended. These are non-threshold-based alerts, also referred to as stateless alerts. Stateless
alerts go directly to the history table. Clearing a stateless alert makes sense only in the Database
Control environment because Database Control stores stateless alerts in its own repository.

Optimal Flexible Architecture (OFA)
OFA is designed to:
? Organize large amounts of software
? Facilitate routine administrative tasks
? Facilitate switching between multiple Oracle databases
? Manage and administer database growth
Optimal Flexible Architecture (OFA)
OFA is a method for configuring the Oracle database and other databases. OFA takes advantage
of the capabilities of the OS and disk subsystems to create an easy-to-administer configuration
that allows maximum flexibility for growing and high-performance databases. The methods
described here are the basics of OFA.
OFA is designed to:
? Organize large amounts of complicated software and data on the disk to avoid device
bottlenecks and poor performance
? Facilitate routine administrative tasks (such as software and data backup) that are often
vulnerable to data corruption
? Facilitate switching between multiple Oracle databases
? Manage and administer database growth
? Help eliminate fragmentation of free space in the data dictionary, isolate other fragmentation, and
minimize resource contention
For details about the goals and implementation of OFA, see the Oracle Installation Guide for your
platform.

Recovery Area. Which two files are removed automatically if the space is required in the FRA as
per the retention policy? (Choose two.)
A. Flashback log files
B. Backups that have become obsolete
C. User managed backups of the data files and control files
D. Archived redo log files that have multiple copies in a different archive location and not backed
up
Answer: A,B
Oracle 1z0-052 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 102
Explanation:
Configuring the Flash Recovery Area
Flash recovery area:
? Strongly recommended for simplified backup storage management
? Space on disk (separate from working database files)
? Location specified by the DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST parameter
? Size specified by DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST parameter
? Large enough for backups, archived logs, flashback logs, mirrored control files, and mirrored
redo logs
? Automatically managed according to your retention policy
Configuring the flash recovery area means determining location, size, and retention policy.
Configuring the Flash Recovery Area
The flash recovery area is a space that is set aside on the disk to contain archived logs, backups,
flashback logs, mirrored control files, and mirrored redo logs. A flash recovery area simplifies
backup storage management and is strongly recommended. You should place the flash recovery
area on a disk that is separate from die working set of database files. Otherwise, the disk becomes
a single point of failure for your database.
The amount of disk space to allocate for the flash recovery area depends on the size and activity
levels of your database. As a general rule, the larger the flash recovery area, the more useful it is.
Ideally, the flash recovery area should be large enough for copies of your data and control files
and for flashback, online redo, and archived logs needed to recover the database with the
backups kept based on the retention policy. (In short, the flash recovery area should be at least
twice the size of the database so that it can hold one backup and several archived logs.)
Space management in the flash recovery area is governed by a backup retention policy. A
retention policy determines when files are obsolete, winch means that they are no longer needed
to meet your data recovery objectives. The Oracle database automatically manages this storage
by deleting files that are no longer needed.

SCOTT has started a query on a large table in the peak transactional hour that performs bulk
inserts. The query runs for more than 15 minutes and then SCOTT receives the following error:
ORA-01555: snapshot too old
What could be the reason for this error?
Exhibit:
A. The query is unable to get a read-consistent image.
B. There is not enough space in Flash Recovery Area.
C. There is not enough free space in the flashback archive.
D. The query is unable to place data blocks in undo tablespace.
Answer: A
Oracle 1z0-052 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 104
Explanation:
The ORA-01555 is caused by Oracle read consistency mechanism. If you have a long running
SQL that starts at 10:30 AM, Oracle ensures that all rows are as they appeared at 10:30 AM, even
if the query runs until noon! Oracles does this by reading the "before image" of changed rows from
the online undo segments. If you have lots of updates, long running SQL and too small UNDO, the
ORA-01555 error will appear.

Upon investigation, you find that SMD is a small file tablespace.
Which three action would allow the user to insert data? (Choose three.)
A. Add a data file to the SMD tablespace.
B. Add a data file to the temporary tablespace associated with the user HR.
C. Resize the data file associated with the SMD tablespace to make it larger.
D. Alter the data file associated with the SMD tablespace to grow automatically.
E. Change the segment space management for the SMD tablespace to automatic.
Answer: A,C,D
Explanation:
The Oracle docs note this on the ora-01653 error:
ORA-01653: unable to extend table string.string by string in tablespace string
Cause: Failed to allocate an extent of the required number of blocks for a table segment in the
tablespace indicated.
Action: Use ALTER TABLESPACE ADD DATAFILE statement to add one or more files to the
tablespace indicated.
Oracle MOSC Documents offer great resources on resolving ORA-01653, namely the nature of
the problem as it relates to space availability:
------------
This error does not necessarily indicate whether or not you have enough space in the tablespace,
it merely indicates that Oracle could not find a large enough area of free contiguous space in
Oracle 1z0-052 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 105
which to fit the next extent.
Diagnostic Steps:
-----------------
1. In order to see the free space available for a particular tablespace, you must use the view
DBA_FREE_SPACE. Within this view, each record represents one fragment of space. How the
view DBA_FREE_SPACE can be used to determine the space available in the database is
described in Note 121259.1 Using DBA_FREE_SPACE
Furthermore, MOSC offers these choices in resolving ORA-01653 (as quoted below):
Manually COALESCE Adjacent Free Extents
Add a DATAFILE

Checkpoint Process (CKPT)
A checkpoint is a data structure that defines a system change number (SCN) in the redo thread of
a database. Checkpoints are recorded in the control file and in each data file header. They are a
crucia element of recovery.
When a checkpoint occurs, Oracle Database must update the headers of all data files to record
the details of the checkpoint. This is done by the CKPT process. The CKPT process does not write
blocks to disk; DBWw always performs that work. The SCNs recorded in the file headers
guarantee that all changes made to database blocks prior to that SCN have been written to disk.
The statistic DDWR checkpoints displayed by the SYSTEM_STATISTICS monitor in Oracle
Enterprise Manager indicate the number of checkpoint requests that have completed.

Which two statements are true regarding the Oracle Data Pump export and import operations?
(Choose two.)

B. You can rename tables during an import operation.
C. You can overwrite existing dump files during an export operation.
Oracle 1z0-052 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 107
D. You can compress the data during export but not the metadata because it is not supported.
Answer: B,C
Explanation:
? Data Pump: Enables the high-speed transfer of data from one database to another (For example,
you may want to export a table and import it into another database.)
Oracle Data Pump: Benefits
The EXCLUDE, INCLUDE, and CONTENT parameters are used for fine-grained object and data
selection.
You can specify die database version for objects to be moved (using the VERSION parameter) to
create a dump file set that is compatible with a previous release of the Oracle database that
supports Data Pump.
You can use the PARALLEL parameter to specify the maximum number of threads of active
execution servers operating on behalf of the export job.
You can estimate how much space an export job would consume (without actually performing the
export) by using the ESTIMATE_ONLY parameter.
Network mode enables you to export from a remote database directly to a dump file set. This can
be done by using a database link to the source system.
During import, you can change the target data file name, scheme, and tablespace.
In addition you can specify a percentage of data to be sampled and unloaded from the source
database when performing a Data Pump export. This can be done by specifying the SAMPLE
parameter.
You can use the COMPRESSION parameter to indicate whether the metadata should be
compressed in the export dump file so that it consumes less disk space. If you compress the
metadata, it is automatically uncompressed during import.

D. Set the snapshot retention period in the Automatic Workload Repository (AWR) to zero to avoid
automatic purging of snapshots.
Answer: B
Explanation:
Database Maintenance
Proactive database maintenance is made easy by the sophisticated infrastructure of the Oracle
database, including the following main elements:
? The Automatic Workload Repository (AWR) is a built-in repository in each Oracle database. At
regular intervals, the Oracle database makes a snapshot of all its vital statistics and workload
information and stores this data in the AWR. The captured data can be analyzed by you, by the
database itself, or by both.
? Using automated tasks, the database performs routine maintenance operations such as regular
backups, refreshing optimizer statistics, and database health checks.
Reactive database maintenance includes critical errors and conditions discovered by database
health checkers:
? For problems that cannot be resolved automatically and require administrators to be notified
(such as running out of space), the Oracle database provides server-generated alerts. The Oracle
database by default monitors itself and sends out alerts to notify you of problems. The alerts notify
you and often also provide recommendations on how to resolve reported problem.
? Recommendations are generated from a number of advisors, each of which is responsible for a
subsystem. For example, there are memory, segment, and SQL advisors.
