QUESTION NO: 2
You want to perform the following operations for the DATA ASM disk group:
Verify the consistency of the disk.
Cross-check all the file extent maps and allocation tables for consistency.
Check whether the alias metadata directory and file directory are linked correctly.
Check that ASM metadata directories do not have unreachable allocated blocks.
Which command accomplishes these tasks?
A. ALTER DISKGROUP data CHECK;
B. ALTER DISKGROUP data CHECK DISK;
C. ALTER DISKGROUP data CHECK FILE;
D. ALTER DISKGROUP data CHECK DISK IN FAILURE GROUP 1;
Answer: A
Explanation:
Syntax: ALTER DISKGROUP <disk_group_id> CHECK [REPAIR | NOREPAIR];
The check_diskgroup_clause lets you verify the internal consistency of Oracle ASM disk group
metadata. The disk group must be mounted. Oracle ASM displays summary errors and writes the
details of the detected errors in the alert log.
The CHECK keyword performs the following operations:

Which two statements are true regarding the functionality of the remap command in ASMCMD?
(Choose two.)
A. It repairs blocks that have read disk I/O errors.
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 3
B. It checks whether the alias metadata directory and the file directory are linked correctly.
C. It repairs blocks by always reading them from the mirror copy and writing them to the original
location.
D. It reads the blocks from a good copy of an ASM mirror and rewrites them to an alternate
location on disk if the blocks on the original location cannot be read properly.
Answer: A,D
Explanation:
Reference from the Oracle document release v11.1 at here:
Repairs a range of physical blocks on a disk. The remap command only repairs blocks that have
read disk I/O errors. It does not repair blocks that contain corrupted contents, whether or not those
blocks can be read. The command assumes a physical block size of 512 bytes and supports all
allocation unit sizes (1 to 64 MB).
Reference from the Oracle document release v11.2 at here:
The remap command marks a range of blocks as unusable on the disk and relocates any data
allocated in that range.
QUESTION NO: 4
What is the advantage of setting the ASM-preferred mirror read for the stretch cluster
configuration?
A. It improves resync operations.
B. This feature enables much faster file opens.
C. It improves performance as fewer extent pointers are needed in the shared pool.
D. It improves performance by reading from a copy of an extent closest to the node.
Answer: D
Explanation:
Preferred Read Failure Groups
When you configure Oracle ASM failure groups, it might be more efficient for a node to read from
an extent that is closest to the node, even if that extent is a secondary extent. In other words, you
can configure Oracle ASM to read from a secondary extent if that extent is closer to the node
instead of Oracle ASM reading from the primary copy which might be farther from the node. Using
the preferred read failure groups feature is most useful in extended clusters.

Examine the following command:
ALTER DISKGROUP data MOUNT FORCE;
In which scenario can you use the above command to mount the disk group?
A. when ASM disk goes offline
B. when one or more ASM files are dropped
C. when some disks in a disk group are offline
D. when some disks in a failure group for a disk group are rebalancing
Answer: C
Explanation:
In the FORCE mode, Oracle ASM attempts to mount the disk group even if it cannot discover all of
the devices that belong to the disk group. This setting is useful if some of the disks in a normal or
high redundancy disk group became unavailable while the disk group was dismounted. When
MOUNT FORCE succeeds, Oracle
ASM takes the missing disks offline.
If Oracle ASM discovers all of the disks in the disk group, then MOUNT FORCE fails. Therefore,
use the MOUNT FORCE setting only if some disks are unavailable. Otherwise, use NOFORCE.
In normal- and high-redundancy disk groups, disks from one failure group can be unavailable and
MOUNT FORCE will succeed. Also in high-redundancy disk groups, two disks in two different
failure groups can be unavailable and MOUNT FORCE will succeed. Any other combination of
unavailable disks causes the operation to fail, because Oracle ASM cannot guarantee that a valid
copy of all user data or metadata exists on the available disks.

QUESTION NO: 6
Which background process of a database instance, using Automatic Storage Management (ASM),
connects as a foreground process into the ASM instance?
A. ASMB
B. PMON
C. RBAL
D. SMON
Answer: A
Explanation:
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 5
ASMB (ASM Background Process): Communicates with the ASM instance, managing storage and
providing statistics, runs in ASM instances when the ASMCMD cp command runs or when the
database instance first starts if the server parameter file is stored in ASM. ASMB also runs with
Oracle Cluster Registry on ASM.
RBAL (ASM Rebalance Master Process): In an ASM instance, it coordinates rebalance activity for
disk groups. In a database instances, it manages ASM disk groups.
PMON (Process Monitor): Monitors the other background processes and performs process
recovery when a server or dispatcher process terminates abnormally.
SMON (System Monitor Process): Performs critical tasks such as instance recovery and dead
transaction recovery, and maintenance tasks such as temporary space reclamation, data
dictionary cleanup, and undo tablespace management
QUESTION NO: 7
Immediately after adding a new disk to or removing an existing disk from an ASM instance, you
find that the performance of the database goes down initially until the time the addition or removal
process is completed, and then gradually becomes normal.
Which two activities would you perform to maintain a consistent performance of the database
while adding or removing disks? (Choose two.)
A. Define the POWER option while adding or removing the disks.
B. Increase the number of ARB processes by setting up a higher value for ASM_POWER_LIMIT.
C. Increase the number of DBWR processes by setting up a higher value for
DB_WRITER_PROCESSES.
D. Increase the number of slave database writer processes by setting up a higher value for
DBWR_IO_SLAVES.
Answer: A,B
Explanation:
ARBn (ASM Rebalance Process): Rebalances data extents within an ASM disk group, possible
processes are ARB0-ARB9 and ARBA.
ALTER DISKGROUP..POWER clause, specify a value from 0 to 11, where 0 stops the rebalance
operation and 11 permits Oracle ASM to execute the rebalance as fast as possible. The value you
specify in the POWER clause defaults to the value of the ASM_POWER_LIMIT initialization
parameter. If you omit the POWER clause, then Oracle ASM executes both automatic and
specified rebalance operations at the power determined by the value of the ASM_POWER_LIMIT
initialization parameter.

You are managing an ASM instance. You previously issued the following statements:
ALTER DISKGROUP dg1 DROP DISK disk2;
ALTER DISKGROUP dg1 DROP DISK disk3;
ALTER DISKGROUP dg1 DROP DISK disk5;
You want to cancel the disk drops that are pending for the DG1 disk group.
Which statement should you issue?
A. ALTER DISKGROUP dg1 UNDROP disk2, disk3, disk5;
B. ALTER DISKGROUP dg1 UNDROP;
C. ALTER DISKGROUP dg1 UNDROP DISKS;
D. You cannot cancel the pending disk drops.
Answer: C
Explanation:
Use this clause to cancel the drop of disks from the disk group. You can cancel the pending drop
of all the disks in one or more disk groups (by specifying diskgroup_name) or of all the disks in all
disk groups (by specifying ALL).
This clause is not relevant for disks that have already been completely dropped from the disk
group or for disk groups that have been completely dropped. This clause results in a long-running
operation. You can see the status of the operation by querying the V$ASM_OPERATION dynamic
performance view.

Users are connected to a database instance that is using Automatic Storage Management (ASM).
The DBA executes the command as follows to shut down the ASM instance:
SQL> SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
What happens to the database instance?
A. It shuts down long with the ASM instance.
B. It is aborted and the ASM instance shuts down normally.
C. It stays open and SHUTDOWN command for the ASM instance fails.
D. It shuts down only after all pending transactions are completed and the ASM instance waits for
this before shutting down.
Answer: C
Explanation:
IMMEDIATE or TRANSACTIONAL Clause (link)
Oracle ASM waits for any in-progress SQL to complete before performing an orderly dismount of
all of the disk groups and shutting down the Oracle ASM instance. Oracle ASM does not wait for
users currently connected to the instance to disconnect. If any database instances are connected
to the Oracle ASM instance, then the SHUTDOWN command returns an error and leaves the
Oracle ASM instance running. Because the Oracle ASM instance does not contain any
transactions, the TRANSACTIONAL mode behaves the same as IMMEDIATE mode.

The underlying disks for these disk groups have apparently been lost.
B. The format of the ASM_DISKGROUPS parameter is incorrect. It should reference the disk
group numbers, not the names of the disk groups
C. The ASM_POWER_LIMIT parameter is incorrectly set to 1. It should be set to the number of
disk groups being attached to the ASM instance.
D. The ASM_DISKSTRING parameter is not set; therefore disk discovery is not possible.
E. There is insufficient information to solve this problem.
Answer: D
Explanation:
ASM_DISKSTRING specifies an operating system-dependent value used by Automatic Storage
Management to limit the set of disks considered for discovery. When a new disk is added to a disk
group, each Automatic Storage Management instance that has the disk group mounted must be
able to discover the new disk using the value of ASM_DISKSTRING.
In most cases, the default value will be sufficient. Using a more restrictive value may reduce the
time required for Automatic Storage Management to perform discovery, and thus improve disk
group mount time or the time for adding a disk to a disk group. A "?" at the beginning of the string
gets expanded to the Oracle home directory. Depending on the operating system, wildcard
characters can be used. It may be necessary to dynamically change ASM_DISKSTRING before
adding a disk so that the new disk will be discovered.
An attempt to dynamically modify ASM_DISKSTRING will be rejected and the old value retained if
the new value cannot be used to discover a disk that is in a disk group that is already mounted.

D. +DG2A.701.2
E. +DG2A/datafile/dev19.users.02.701.2
Answer: B
Explanation:
Fully Qualified File Name Form (link)
A fully qualified file name has the following form:
+diskgroup/dbname/filetype/filetypetag.file.incarnation
Where:
+diskgroup is the disk group name preceded by a plus sign. You can think of the plus sign (+) as
the root directory of the Oracle ASM file system, similar to the slash (/) on UNIX or Linux
computers.
dbname is the DB_UNIQUE_NAME of the database to which the file belongs.
filetype is the Oracle file type and can be one of the file types shown in Table 7-3.
filetypetag is type-specific information about the file and can be one of the tags shown in Table 7-
3.
file.incarnation is the file/incarnation pair, used to ensure uniqueness.
For example,
filetype = 'DATAFILE', Data files and data file copies
filetypetag = 'tblspname', Name of the tablespace into which the file is added

B. A new disk cannot be added to a disk group.
C. A disk in a disk group can be taken offline.
D. The client RDBMS instance cannot access the files in the disk group.
Answer: D
Explanation:
MOUNT (link)
Specify MOUNT to mount the disk groups in the local Oracle ASM instance. Specify ALL MOUNT
to mount all disk groups specified in the ASM_DISKGROUPS initialization parameter. File
operations can only be performed when a disk group is mounted. If Oracle ASM is running in a
cluster or a standalone server managed by Oracle Restart, then the MOUNT clause automatically
brings the corresponding resource online.
RESTRICTED | NORMAL Use these clauses to determine the manner in which the disk groups
are mounted.
In the RESTRICTED mode, the disk group is mounted in single-instance exclusive mode. No other
Oracle ASM instance in the same cluster can mount that disk group. In this mode the disk group is
not usable by any Oracle ASM client.
In the NORMAL mode, the disk group is mounted in shared mode, so that other Oracle ASM
instances and clients can access the disk group. This is the default.

D. ALTER DISKGROUP misc RESIZE ALL SIZE 1023m;
E. ALTER DISKGROUP dgroupA ADD DISK '/devices/A*';
Answer: A,C
Explanation:
Altering Disk Groups
You can use the ALTER DISKGROUP SQL statement to alter a disk group configuration. You can
add, resize, or drop disks while the database remains online. Whenever possible, multiple
operations in a single ALTER DISKGROUP statement are recommended. Grouping operations in
a single ALTER DISKGROUP statement can reduce rebalancing operations.
Oracle ASM automatically rebalances when the configuration of a disk group changes. By default,
the ALTER DISKGROUP statement does not wait until the operation is complete before returning.
Query the V$ASM_OPERATION view to monitor the status of this operation.
add_disk_clause
Use this clause to add one or more disks to the disk group and specify attributes for the newly
added disk. Oracle ASM automatically rebalances the disk group as part of this operation.
drop_disk_clause
Use this clause to drop one or more disks from the disk group.
DROP DISK
The DROP DISK clause lets you drop one or more disks from the disk group and automatically
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 32
rebalance the disk group. When you drop a disk, Oracle ASM relocates all the data from the disk
and clears the disk header so that it no longer is part of the disk group. The disk header is not
cleared if you specify the FORCE keyword.

C. The command must be reissued with a more specific discovery string.
D. The other disks, already part of the disk group, are ignored.
Answer: C
Explanation:
Refer to an Oracle Example for adding disk to diskgroup (link)
How A Disk is Discovered
While an ASM instance is initialized, ASM discovers and examines the contents of all of the disks
that are in the paths that you designated with values in the ASM_DISKSTRING initialization
parameter. Disk discovery also occurs when you:
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 33
Disk Discovery Rules(link)
The rules for discovering ASM disks are as follows:
Note:
ASM does not discover a disk that contains an operating system partition table, even if the disk is
in an ASM disk string search path and ASM has read and write permission for the disk.
In addition, ASM identifies the following configuration errors during discovery:
In this case, if the disk is part of a disk group, then disk group mount fails. If the disk is being
added to a disk group with the ADD DISK or CREATE DISKGROUP command, then the
command fails. To correct the error, adjust the ASM_DISKSTRING value so that ASM will not
discover multiple paths to the same disk. Or if you are using multipathing software, then ensure
that you include only the pseudo-device name in the ASM_DISKSTRING value. See "ASM and
Multipathing".
This can be caused by having copied one disk onto another. In this case, the disk group mount
operation fails.
QUESTION NO: 56
You are an Oracle DBA responsible for an ASM instance. The disk controller on your system fails.
You suspect that the disk itself is okay. You know it will take 24 hours to replace the controller and
you don't want to have to rebuild the disks from scratch.
What do you do?
A. Take the whole disk group offline and wait for the controller card to be installed. Once it's
installed, bring the disk group online again.
B. Change the ASM parameter ASM_PREFERRED_READ_FAILURE_GROUPS to indicate that
you want to read from the non-failed disk. Once the disk controller is replaced, reset the parameter
to its original value.
C. You have no choice but to rebuild the disk. Drop the disk from the disk group and wait for the
controller to be replaced. Once the controller is replaced, add the disk back into the disk group and
allow ASM to rebuild it.
D. If you are using any setting other than REDUNDANCY EXTERNAL for your disk group, you will
have to recover any data on that disk from a backup. The database will be unavailable until you
can correct the problem and perform recovery.

C. ASM starts the Oracle Cluster Synchronization Services (CSS) daemon if it is not started
D. ASM discovers and examines the contents of all files that are in the paths specified in the
ASM_DISKGROUPS initialization parameters
Answer: B,C
Explanation:
Refer to Starting Up an ASM Instance.
To start up an ASM instance, you must:
1. To connect to the ASM instance with SQL*Plus, you must set the ORACLE_SID environment
variable to the ASM SID.
2. The initialization parameter file, which can be a server parameter file, must contain:
INSTANCE_TYPE = ASM
3. The STARTUP command, tries to mount the disk groups specified by the initialization
parameter ASM_DISKGROUPS.
If ASM_DISKGROUPS is blank, the ASM instance starts and warns that no disk groups were
mounted. You can then mount disk groups with the ALTER DISKGROUP...MOUNT command.
The Cluster Synchronization Services (CSS) daemon is required to enable synchronization
between ASM and its client database instances. The CSS daemon is normally started (and
configured to start upon reboot) when you use Database Configuration Assistant (DBCA) to create
your database. If you did not use DBCA to create the database, you must ensure that the CSS
daemon is running before you start the ASM instance.

hours:
ALTER DISKGROUP dg01 SET ATTRIBUTE 'disk_repair_time' = '5h';
To which disks in the disk group will the new value be applicable?
A. all disks in the disk group
B. all disks that are currently in OFFLINE mode
C. all disks that are not currently in OFFLINE mode
D. all disks in the disk group only if all of them are ONLINE

Check out the answer options, it is tricky. The NOT OFFLINE disks equals ONLINE disks.
Refer to Set the DISK_REPAIR_TIME Disk Group Attribute Appropriately.
The DISK_REPAIR_TIME disk group attribute specifies how long a disk remains offline before
Oracle ASM drops the disk. If a disk is made available before the DISK_REPAIR_TIME parameter
has expired, the storage administrator can issue the ONLINE DISK command and Oracle ASM
resynchronizes the stale data from the mirror side. In Oracle Database 11g, the online disk
operation does not restart if there is a failure of the instance on which the disk is running. You
must reissue the command manually to bring the disk online.

Explanation:
Detection of Block Corruption (link)
Oracle Database supports different techniques for detecting, repairing, and monitoring block
corruption. The technique depends on whether the corruption is interblock corruption or intrablock
corruption. In intrablock corruption, the corruption occurs within the block itself. This corruption can
be either physical or logical. In aninterblock corruption, the corruption occurs between blocks and
can only be logical.
For example, the V$DATABASE_BLOCK_CORRUPTION view records intrablock corruptions,
while the Automatic Diagnostic Repository (ADR) tracks all types of corruptions. Table 16-1
summarizes how the database treats different types of block corruption.

E. backup validate
Answer: A
Explanation:
Crosscheck
A check to determine whether files on disk or in the media management catalog correspond to the
data in the RMAN repository. Because the media manager can mark tapes as expired or
unusable, and because files can be deleted from disk or otherwise become corrupted, the RMAN
repository can contain outdated information about backups. Run the CROSSCHECK command to
perform a crosscheck.
The "control file" in the QUESTION NO is acting as the RMAN repository if the RMAN use control
file store metadata.

E. Repair all corrupted blocks that have been logged in the
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 53
V$DATABASE_BLOCK_CORRUPTION
Answer: D,E
Explanation:
V$DATABASE_BLOCK_CORRUPTION displays information about database blocks that were
corrupted after the last backup.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BACKUP...VALIDATE
Scans the specified files and verifies their contents, testing whether this file can be backed up and
whether the data blocks are corrupt. RMAN creates no output files.
This option is equivalent to using the VALIDATE command on the database files specified in the
backup. If you do not specify CHECK LOGICAL, then BACKUP..VALIDATE checks for physical
corruption only. If you specify CHECK LOGICAL, then BACKUP VALIDATE checks for both
physical and logical corruption.
RMAN populates the V$DATABASE_BLOCK_CORRUPTION view with any corruptions that it
finds.
You can use the SET MAXCORRUPT command to set a limit for the number of corrupt blocks
tolerated during the backup validation. The default is zero.
If you execute BACKUP INCREMENTAL with VALIDATE, then the behavior depends on whether
block change tracking is enabled. If change tracking is enabled, then RMAN validates only
changed blocks; otherwise, RMAN validates all blocks in the files included in the backup.
Note: You cannot validate backups of backup sets.

The following prerequisites apply to RECOVER BLOCK: (link)
QUESTION NO: 92
Which statement is true regarding the VALIDATE DATABASE command?

B. It checks for block corruption in the valid backups of the database.
C. It checks the database for both intrablock and interblock corruptions.
D. It checks for only those corrupted blocks that are associated with data files.
Answer: A
Explanation:
interblock corruption
A type of block corruption in which the corruption occurs between blocks rather than within the
block itself. This type of corruption can only be logical corruption.
intrablock corruption A type of block corruption in which the corruption occurs within the block

C. The initialization parameter should be set to greater than 0 with the RMAN repository utilizing
the control file or the recovery catalog.
D. The initialization parameter should be set to 0 with the RMAN repository utilizing the control file
or the recovery catalog.
E. The initialization parameter should never be set to 0 if you are using RMAN.
Answer: C,E
Explanation:
CONTROL_FILE_RECORD_KEEP_TIME specifies the minimum number of days before a
reusable record in the control file can be reused. In the event a new record needs to be added to a
reusable section and the oldest record has not aged enough, the record section expands. If this
parameter is set to 0, then reusable sections never expand, and records are reused as needed.
If the number of reusable records in the control file exceeds the circular reuse record limit
UB4MAXVAL, then reusable records will be overwritten even if
CONTROL_FILE_RECORD_KEEP_TIME has not elapsed.
UB4MAXVAL is defined in the oratypes.h header file, which is found in the public directory. Its
value may vary according to the operating system you are using.

E. Make recovery faster
Answer: B,C,D
Explanation:
A recovery catalog is a database schema used by RMAN to store metadata about one or more
Oracle databases. Typically, you store the catalog in a dedicated database. A recovery catalog
provides the following benefits:
Some RMAN features function only when you use a recovery catalog. For example, you can store
RMAN scripts in a recovery catalog. The chief advantage of a stored script is that it is available to
any RMAN client that can connect to the target database and recovery catalog. Command files are
only available if the RMAN client has access to the file system on which they are stored.
A recovery catalog is required when you use RMAN in a Data Guard environment. By storing
backup metadata for all primary and standby databases, the catalog enables you to offload
backup tasks to one standby database while enabling you to restore backups on other databases
in the environment.
QUESTION NO: 122
RMAN provides more granular catalog security through which feature?
A. Virtual private database
B. Virtual private catalog
C. RMAN virtual database
D. RMAN secure catalog
E. Oracle Database Vault
Answer: B
Explanation:
About Virtual Private Catalogs
By default, all of the users of an RMAN recovery catalog have full privileges to insert, update, and
delete any metadata in the catalog. For example, if the administrators of two unrelated databases
share the same recovery catalog, each administrator could, whether inadvertently or maliciously,
destroy catalog data for the other's database. In many enterprises, this situation is tolerated
because the same people manage many different databases and also manage the recovery
catalog. But in other enterprises where clear separation of duty exists between administrators of
various databases, and between the DBA and the administrator of the recovery catalog, you may
desire to restrict each database administrator to modify only backup metadata belonging to those
databases that they are responsible for, while still keeping the benefits of a single,
centrallymanaged, RMAN recovery catalog. This goal can be achieved by implementing virtual

Which statement about using RMAN stored scripts is true?
A. To create and execute an RMAN stored script, you must use a recovery catalog.
B. When executing a stored script and a command fails, the remainder of the script is executed,
and a message is written to the alert log file.
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 70
C. RMAN stored scripts can always be executed against any target database that is registered in
the recovery catalog.
D. When you execute a stored script, it always executes using the persistent channel settings
previously set with the CONFIGURE command.
Answer: A
Explanation:
About Stored Scripts
You can use a stored script as an alternative to a command file for managing frequently used
sequences of RMAN commands. The script is stored in the recovery catalog rather than on the file
system.
Stored scripts can be local or global. A local script is associated with the target database to which
RMAN is connected when the script is created, and can only be executed when you are connected
to that target database. A global stored script can be run against any database registered in the
recovery catalog, if the RMAN client is connected to the recovery catalog and a target database.
The commands allowable within the brackets of the CREATE SCRIPT command are the same
commands supported within a RUN block. Any command that is legal within a RUN command is
permitted in the stored script. The following commands are not legal within stored scripts: RUN,
@, and @@.
When specifying a script name, RMAN permits but generally does not require that you use quotes
around the name of a stored script. If the name begins with a digit or is an RMAN reserved word,
however, then you must put quotes around the name to use it as a stored script name. Consider
avoiding stored script names that begin with nonalphabetic characters or that are the same as
RMAN reserved words.

The basic steps for creating a virtual private catalog are as follows:
1. Create the database user who will own the virtual private catalog (if this user does not exist) and
grant this user access privileges.
1.1 Start SQL*Plus and connect to the recovery catalog database with administrator privileges.
1.2 If the user that will own the virtual private catalog does not exist, then create the user.
SQL> CREATE USER vpc1 IDENTIFIED BY password DEFAULT TABLESPACE vpcusers
QUOTA UNLIMITED ON vpcusers;
1.3 Grant the RECOVERY_CATALOG_OWNER role to the database user that will own the virtual
private catalog, and then exit SQL*Plus.
SQL> GRANT recovery_catalog_owner TO vpc1;
1.4 Start RMAN and connect to the recovery catalog database as the base recovery catalog owner
(not the virtual private catalog owner).
RMAN> CONNECT CATALOG catowner@catdb;
1.5 Grant desired privileges to the virtual private catalog owner.
RMAN> GRANT CATALOG FOR DATABASE prod1 TO vpc1;
You can also use a DBID rather than a database name. The virtual private catalog user does not
have access to the metadata for any other databases registered in the recovery catalog.
You can also grant the user the ability to register new target databases in the recovery catalog.
For example:
RMAN> GRANT REGISTER DATABASE TO vpc1;
2. Create the virtual private catalog.
2.1 Start RMAN and connect to the recovery catalog database as the virtual private catalog owner
(not the base recovery catalog owner).
RMAN> CONNECT CATALOG vpc1@catdb;
2.2 Create the virtual private catalog.
RMAN> CREATE VIRTUAL CATALOG;
If you intend to use a 10.2 or earlier release of RMAN with this virtual private catalog, then execute
the following PL/SQL procedure (where base_catalog_owner is the database user who owns the
base recovery catalog):
SQL> EXECUTE base_catalog_owner.DBMS_RCVCAT.CREATE_VIRTUAL_CATALOG;

Add backup pieces and image copies on disk to the RMAN repository
Record a data file copy as a level 0 incremental backup in the RMAN repository, which enables
you to use it as part of an incremental backup strategy START WITH 'string_pattern'
Catalogs all valid backup sets, data file and control file copies, and archived redo log files whose
name start with string_pattern. The string pattern can be an ASM disk group, Oracle-managed
files directory, or part of a file name (see Example 2-32).
RMAN reports any files in the disk location that it cannot catalog. RMAN must be connected to a
mounted target database.
If the string pattern specifies a file name, then it matches the left part of the file name pattern. For
example, / tmp/arc matches everything in directory /tmp/arc_dest and /tmp/archive/january as well
as file /tmp/arc.cpy. Note: You cannot use wildcard characters in the string pattern, only a strict

Configuring the Recovery Catalog Database
When you use a recovery catalog, RMAN requires that you maintain a recovery catalog schema.
The recovery catalog is stored in the default tablespace of the schema. The SYS user cannot be
the owner of the recovery catalog.
Decide which database you will use to install the recovery catalog schema, and also how you will
back up this database. Also, decide whether to operate the catalog database in ARCHIVELOG
mode, which is recommended.
Note: Do not use the target database to be backed up as the database for the recovery catalog.
The recovery catalog must be protected if the target database is lost.

LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_2 = 'LOCATION=/disk2/arch'
LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_3 = 'LOACTION=/disk3/arch'
LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_4 = 'LOCATION=/disk4/arch MANDATORY'
Identify the statement that correctly describes this setting.
A. The MANDATORY location must be a flash recovery area.
B. The optional destinations may not use the flash recovery area.
C. This setting is not allowed because the first destination is not set as MANDATORY.
D. The online redo log file is not allowed to be overwritten if the archived log cannot be created in
the fourth destination.
Answer: D
Explanation:
MANDATORY
Specifies that filled online log files must be successfully archived to the destination before they can
be reused.
If MANDATORY is not specified, then, by default, the destination is considered to be optional.
At least one destination must succeed, even if all destinations are optional. If archiving to an
optional destination fails, the online redo log file is still available for reuse and may be overwritten
eventually. However, if the archival operation of a mandatory destination fails, online redo log files

B. Archived redo logs are backed up only if the database is open during the backup.
C. The backup is deleted after one day, regardless of the default retention policy settings.
D. The backup becomes obsolete after one day, regardless of the default retention policy settings.
Answer: B,D
Explanation:
Refer to here.
KeepOption
Overrides any configured retention policy for this backup so that the backup is not considered
obsolete, as shown in Example 2-26.
You can use the KEEP syntax to generate archival database backups that satisfy business or
legal requirements. The KEEP setting is an attribute of the backup set (not individual backup
piece) or image copy.
Note: You cannot use KEEP with BACKUP BACKUPSET.
With the KEEP syntax, you can keep the backups so that they are considered obsolete after a
specified time (KEEP UNTIL), or make them never obsolete (KEEP FOREVER). As shown in
Example 2-27, you must be connected to a recovery catalog when you specify KEEP FOREVER.
Note: You can use CHANGE to alter the status of a backup generated with KEEP.
See Also: keepOption for more information about backups made with the KEEP option.
Creating a Consistent Database Backup for Archival Purposes:
This example uses a keepOption to create an archival backup set that cannot be considered
obsolete for one year. The example backs up the database, archives the redo in the current online
logs to ensure that this new backup is consistent, and backs up only those archived redo log files
needed to restore the data file backup to a consistent state.
The BACKUP command also creates a restore point to match the SCN at which this backup is
consistent.
The FORMAT parameter must be capable of creating multiple backup pieces in multiple backup
sets.

Answer: C,D
Explanation:
Deleting Expired RMAN Backups and Copies
If you run CROSSCHECK, and if RMAN cannot locate the files, then it updates their records in the
RMAN repository to EXPIRED status. You can then use the DELETE EXPIRED command to
remove records of expired backups and copies from the RMAN repository.
The DELETE EXPIRED command issues warnings if any files marked as EXPIRED actually exist.
In rare cases, the repository can mark a file as EXPIRED even though it exists. For example, a
directory containing a file is corrupted at the time of the crosscheck, but is later repaired, or the
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 103
media manager was not configured properly and reported some backups as not existing when
they really existed.
To delete expired repository records:
If you have not performed a crosscheck recently, then issue a CROSSCHECK command. For
example, issue:
CROSSCHECK BACKUP;
Delete the expired backups. For example, issue:
DELETE EXPIRED BACKUP;
Deleting Obsolete RMAN Backups Based on Retention Policies
The RMAN DELETE command supports an OBSOLETE option, which deletes backups that are
no longer needed to satisfy specified recoverability requirements. You can delete files that are
obsolete according to the configured default retention policy, or another retention policy that you
specify as an option to the DELETE OBSOLETE command. As with other forms of the DELETE
command, the files deleted are removed from backup media, deleted from the recovery catalog,
and marked as DELETED in the control file.
If you specify the DELETE OBSOLETE command with no arguments, then RMAN deletes all
obsolete backups defined by the configured retention policy. For example:
DELETE OBSOLETE;
QUESTION NO: 186

Answer: B,C
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 107
Explanation:
Crosscheck are useful because they can do the following: (Link)
Use the CROSSCHECK command to synchronize the physical reality of backups and copies with
their logical records in the RMAN repository.
The CROSSCHECK command checks only objects marked AVAILABLE or EXPIRED in the
repository by examining the files on disk for DISK channels or by querying the media manager for
sbt channels.
Meaning of Crosscheck Status:
EXPIRED
Object is not found either in file system (for DISK) or in the media manager (for sbt). A backup set
is EXPIRED if any backup piece in the set is EXPIRED.
The CROSSCHECK command does not delete the repository records of the files that it does not
find, but updates their repository records to EXPIRED. You can run DELETE EXPIRED to remove
the repository records for expired files and any existing physical files whose status is EXPIRED.
If backups are EXPIRED, then you can re-execute the crosscheck later and determine whether
expired backups are available. This precaution is especially useful when you use RMAN with a
media manager. For example, if some backup pieces or copies were erroneously marked as
EXPIRED because the PARMS channel settings were incorrect, then after ensuring that the files
really do exist in the media manager, run the CROSSCHECK BACKUP command again to restore
those files to AVAILABLE status.
AVAILABLE
Object is available for use by RMAN. For a backup set to be AVAILABLE, all backup pieces in the
set must have the status AVAILABLE.

E. 2,1,3,4,5
Answer: E
Explanation:
Backing Up a Database in NOARCHIVELOG Mode
If a database runs in NOARCHIVELOG mode, then the only valid database backup is a consistent
backup. For the backup to be consistent, the database must be mounted after a consistent
shutdown. No recovery is required after restoring the backup.
To make a consistent database backup:
1. Start RMAN and connect to a target database.
2. Shut down the database consistently and then mount it.
For example, enter the following commands to guarantee that the database is in a consistent state
for a backup:
RMAN> SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
RMAN> STARTUP FORCE DBA;
RMAN> SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
RMAN> STARTUP MOUNT;
3. Run the BACKUP DATABASE command.
For example, enter the following command at the RMAN prompt to back up the database to the
default backup device:
RMAN> BACKUP DATABASE;
The following variation of the command creates image copy backups of all data files in the
database:
RMAN> BACKUP AS COPY DATABASE;
4. Open the database and resume normal operations.
The following command opens the database:
RMAN> ALTER DATABASE OPEN;

You must put a read/write tablespace in backup mode to make user-managed data file backups
when the tablespace is online and the database is open. The ALTER TABLESPACE ... BEGIN
BACKUP statement places a tablespace in backup mode. In backup mode, the database copies
whole changed data blocks into the redo stream. After you take the tablespace out of backup
mode with the ALTER TABLESPACE ... END BACKUP or ALTER DATABASE END BACKUP

Recovering After Losing All Members of an Online Redo Log Group
If a media failure damages all members of an online redo log group, then different scenarios can
occur depending on the type of online redo log group affected by the failure and the archiving

mode of the database.
If the damaged online redo log group is current and active, then it is needed for crash recovery;
otherwise, it is not. Table 30-4 outlines the various recovery scenarios.
QUESTION NO: 233
In your test database:
You are using Recovery Manager (RMAN) to perform incremental backups of your test database
The test database is running in NOARCHIVELOG mode
One of the data files is corrupted
All online redo log files are lost because of a media failure
Which option must you consider in this scenario?
A. Configuring the database in ARCHVIELOG mode and then using incremental backup to
recover the database
B. Using incremental backup to recover the damaged data file and then manually creating the
online redo log files
C. Creating a new test database because the database is not recoverable due to the fact that the
database is configured in NOARCHIVELOG mode
D. Using incremental backups to recover the database by using the RECOVER DATABASE
NOREDO command and then using the RESETLOGS option to open the database.
Answer: D
Explanation:
Example 3-6 Recovering a NOARCHIVELOG Database
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 132
You can perform limited recovery of changes to a database running in NOARCHIVELOG mode by
applying incremental backups. The incremental backups must be consistent, like all backups of a
database run in NOARCHIVELOG mode, so you cannot back up the database when it is open.
Assume that you run database prod in NOARCHIVELOG mode with a recovery catalog. You shut
down the database consistently and make a level 0 backup of database prod to tape on Sunday
afternoon. You shut down the database consistently and make a level 1 differential incremental
backup to tape at 3:00 a.m. on Wednesday and Friday.
On Saturday, a media failure destroys half the data files and the online redo logs. Because the
online logs are lost, you must specify the NOREDO option in the RECOVER command.
Otherwise, RMAN searches for the redo logs after applying the Friday incremental backup and
issues an error message when it does not find them.
After connecting RMAN to prod and the catalog database, recover as follows:
STARTUP FORCE NOMOUNT;
RESTORE CONTROLFILE; # restore control file from consistent backup
ALTER DATABASE MOUNT;
RESTORE DATABASE; # restore data files from consistent backup
RECOVER DATABASE NOREDO; # specify NOREDO because online redo logs are lost
ALTER DATABASE OPEN RESETLOGS;
The recovered database reflects only changes up through the time of the Friday incremental
backup. Because there are no archived redo log files, there is no way to recover changes made
after the incremental backup.

Which command will result in a trace file being created with the create controlfile command
contained in it?
A. alter database backup controlfile;
B. alter database backup controlfile to trace;
C. alter database controlfile backup;
D. alter database controlfile backup to '/ora01/oracle/ctrl_backup.ctl';
E. alter database begin controlfile backup;
Answer: B
Explanation:
ALTER DATABASE BACKUP CONTROLFILE TO TRACE
Specify TO TRACE if you want Oracle Database to write SQL statements to a trace file rather than
making a physical backup of the control file. You can use SQL statements written to the trace file
to start up the database, re-create the control file, and recover and open the database
appropriately, based on the created control file. If you issue an ALTER DATABASE BACKUP
CONTROLFILE TO TRACE statement while block change tracking is enabled, then the resulting
trace file will contain a command to reenable block change tracking.
The trace file will also include ALTER DATABASE REGISTER LOGFILE statements for existing
logfiles that reside in the current archivelog destinations. This will implicitly create database
incarnation records for the branches of redo to which the logfiles apply.

You can copy the statements from the trace file into a script file, edit the statements as necessary,
and use the script if all copies of the control file are lost (or to change the size of the control file).

A database has three online redo log groups with one member each. A redo log member with the
status ACTIVE is damages while the database is running.
What is the first step you should take to solve this problem?
A. Attempt to Issue a checkpoint.
B. Restart the database using the RESETLOGS option.
C. Drop the redo log number and create it in a different location.
D. Perform and incomplete recovery up to the most recent available redo log.
Answer: A
Explanation:
Recovering After Losing All Members of an Online Redo Log Group
If a media failure damages all members of an online redo log group, then different scenarios can
occur depending on the type of online redo log group affected by the failure and the archiving
mode of the database. If the damaged online redo log group is current and active, then it is
needed for crash recovery; otherwise, it is not.
Recovering After the Loss of an Online Redo Log Group
Inactive
It is not needed for crash recovery Clear the archived or unarchived group.
Active
It is needed for crash recovery Attempt to issue a checkpoint and clear the log; if impossible, then
you must either use Flashback Database or restore a backup and perform incomplete recovery up

Answer: C
Explanation:
About Recovery with a Backup Control File
If all copies of the current control file are lost or damaged, then you must restore and mount a
backup control file. You must then run the RECOVER command, even if no data files have been
restored, and open the database with the RESETLOGS option. If some copies of the current
control file are usable, however, then you can follow the procedure in "Responding to the Loss of a
Subset of the Current Control Files" and avoid the recovery and RESETLOGS operation.
When RMAN is connected to a recovery catalog, the recovery procedure with a backup control file
is identical to recovery with a current control file. The RMAN metadata missing from the backup
control file is available from the recovery catalog. The only exception is if the database name is not
unique in the catalog, in which case you must use SET DBID command before restoring the
control file.
1. Start RMAN and connect to a target database.
2. Start the target instance without mounting the database. RMAN>STARTUP NOMOUNT;
3. Restore the control file
RMAN> SET DBID 320066378; # (Optional) If the database name is not unique, you
need to specify the DBID
RMAN> RUN
{
SET CONTROLFILE AUTOBACKUP FORMAT FOR DEVICE TYPE DISK TO
'autobackup_format';
RESTORE CONTROLFILE FROM AUTOBACKUP;
}
4. Start the target instance with mounting the database. RMAN>STARTUP MOUNT;
5. Restore the data files; RMAN>RESTORE DATABASE;
6. Recover the database; RMAN>RECOVER DATABASE;
7. Open the database with RESETLOGS option; RMAN> ALTER DATABASE OPEN
RESETLOGS;

QUESTION NO: 285
Your production database is functional on the SHOST1 host. You are backing up the production
database by using Recovery Manager (RMAN) with the recovery catalog. You want to replicate
the production database to anther host, SHOST2, for testing new applications.
After you ensured that the backups of the target database are accessible on the new host, what
must you do to restore and recover the backup for the test environment?
A. Restoring the control file from the backup by using the NOCATALOG option to restore, and
recovering the data files
B. Restoring the data files by using the NOCATALOG option and using the SET NEWNAME
command to change the location
C. Restoring the server parameter file from the backup by using the recovery catalog to restore,
D. Restoring the data files from the backup by using the recovery catalog to recover the files, and
using the SWITCH command to change the location.
Answer: A
Explanation:
Refer to here:
To restore the database on a new host:
1. Ensure that the backups of the target database are accessible on the new host.
2. Configure the ORACLE_SID on hostb.
3. Start RMAN on hostb and connect to the target database without connecting to the recovery
catalog.
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 164
For example, enter the following command:
% rman NOCATALOG
RMAN> CONNECT TARGET
/
4. Set the DBID and start the database instance without mounting the database.
For example, run SET DBID to set the DBID, then run STARTUP NOMOUNT:
SET DBID 1340752057;
STARTUP NOMOUNT
RMAN fails to find the server parameter file, which has not yet been restored, but starts the
instance with a "dummy" file. Sample output follows:
startup failed: ORA-01078: failure in processing system parameters
LRM-00109: could not open parameter file '/net/hostb/oracle/dbs/inittrgta.ora'
trying to start the Oracle instance without parameter files ...
Oracle instance started
5. Restore and edit the server parameter file.
Allocate a channel to the media manager, then restore the server parameter file as a client-side
parameter file and use the SET command to indicate the location of the autobackup (in this
example, the autobackup is in /tmp):
RUN
{
ALLOCATE CHANNEL c1 DEVICE TYPE sbt PARMS '...';
SET CONTROLFILE AUTOBACKUP FORMAT FOR DEVICE TYPE DISK TO '/tmp/%F';
RESTORE SPFILE
TO PFILE '?/oradata/test/inittrgta.ora'
FROM AUTOBACKUP;
SHUTDOWN ABORT;
}
6. Edit the restored initialization parameter file.
Change any location-specific parameters, for example, those ending in _DEST, to reflect the new
directory structure. For example, edit the following parameters:
- IFILE
- LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_1
- CONTROL_FILES
7. Restart the instance with the edited initialization parameter file.
For example, enter the following command:
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 165
STARTUP FORCE NOMOUNT PFILE='?/oradata/test/inittrgta.ora';
8. Restore the control file from an autobackup and then mount the database.
For example, enter the following command:
RUN
{
ALLOCATE CHANNEL c1 DEVICE TYPE sbt PARMS '...';
RESTORE CONTROLFILE FROM AUTOBACKUP;
ALTER DATABASE MOUNT;
}
RMAN restores the control file to whatever locations you specified in the CONTROL_FILES
initialization parameter.
9. Catalog the data file copies that you copied in "Restoring Disk Backups to a New Host", using
their new file names or CATALOG START WITH (if you know all the files are in directories with a
common prefix easily addressed with a CATALOG START WITH command). For example, run:
CATALOG START WITH '/oracle/oradata/trgt/';
If you want to specify files individually, then you can execute a CATALOG command as follows:
CATALOG DATAFILECOPY
'/oracle/oradata/trgt/system01.dbf', '/oracle/oradata/trgt/undotbs01.dbf',
'/oracle/oradata/trgt/cwmlite01.dbf', '/oracle/oradata/trgt/drsys01.dbf',
'/oracle/oradata/trgt/example01.dbf', '/oracle/oradata/trgt/indx01.dbf',
'/oracle/oradata/trgt/tools01.dbf', '/oracle/oradata/trgt/users01.dbf';
10. Start a SQL*Plus session on the new database and query the database file names recorded in
the control file.
Because the control file is from the trgta database, the recorded file names use the original hosta
file names. You can query V$ views to obtain this information. Run the following query in
SQL*Plus:
COLUMN NAME FORMAT a60
SPOOL LOG '/tmp/db_filenames.out'
SELECT FILE# AS "File/Grp#", NAME
FROM V$DATAFILE
UNION
SELECT GROUP#,MEMBER
FROM V$LOGFILE;
SPOOL OFF

11. Write the RMAN restore and recovery script. The script must include the following steps:
a. For each data file on the destination host that is restored to a different path than it had on the
source host, use a SET NEWNAME command to specify the new path on the destination host. If
the file systems on the destination system are set up to have the same paths as the source host,
then do not use SET NEWNAME for those files restored to the same path as on the source host.
b. For each online redo log that is to be created at a different location than it had on the source
host, use SQL ALTER DATABASE RENAME FILE commands to specify the path name on the
destination host. If the file systems on the destination system are set up to have the same paths
as the source host, then do not use ALTER DATABASE RENAME FILE for those files restored to
the same path as on the source host.
c. Perform a SET UNTIL operation to limit recovery to the end of the archived redo logs. The
recovery stops with an error if no SET UNTIL command is specified.
d. Restore and recover the database.
e. Run the SWITCH DATAFILE ALL command so that the control file recognizes the new path
names as the official new names of the data files.
Example 20-3 shows the RMAN script reco_test.rman that can perform the restore and recovery
operation.
Example 20-3 Restoring a Database on a New Host:
RUN
{
# allocate a channel to the tape device
ALLOCATE CHANNEL c1 DEVICE TYPE sbt PARMS '...';
# rename the data files and online redo logs
SET NEWNAME FOR DATAFILE 1 TO '?/oradata/test/system01.dbf';
SET NEWNAME FOR DATAFILE 2 TO '?/oradata/test/undotbs01.dbf';
SET NEWNAME FOR DATAFILE 3 TO '?/oradata/test/cwmlite01.dbf';
SET NEWNAME FOR DATAFILE 4 TO '?/oradata/test/drsys01.dbf';
SET NEWNAME FOR DATAFILE 5 TO '?/oradata/test/example01.dbf';
SET NEWNAME FOR DATAFILE 6 TO '?/oradata/test/indx01.dbf';
SET NEWNAME FOR DATAFILE 7 TO '?/oradata/test/tools01.dbf';
SET NEWNAME FOR DATAFILE 8 TO '?/oradata/test/users01.dbf';
SQL "ALTER DATABASE RENAME FILE ''/dev3/oracle/dbs/redo01.log''
TO ''?/oradata/test/redo01.log'' ";
SQL "ALTER DATABASE RENAME FILE ''/dev3/oracle/dbs/redo02.log''
TO ''?/oradata/test/redo02.log'' ";
# Do a SET UNTIL to prevent recovery of the online logs

# restore the database and switch the data file names
RESTORE DATABASE;
SWITCH DATAFILE ALL;
# recover the database
RECOVER DATABASE;
}
EXIT
12. Execute the script created in the previous step.
For example, start RMAN to connect to the target database and run the @ command:
% rman TARGET / NOCATALOG
RMAN> @reco_test.rman
13. Open the restored database with the RESETLOGS option.
From the RMAN prompt, open the database with the RESETLOGS option:
ALTER DATABASE OPEN RESETLOGS;
Caution:
When you re-open your database in the next step, do not connect to the recovery catalog.
Otherwise, the new database incarnation created is registered automatically in the recovery
catalog, and the file names of the production database are replaced by the new file names
specified in the script.
14. Optionally, delete the test database with all of its files.
Note:
If you used an ASM disk group, then the DROP DATABASE command is the only way to safely
remove the files of the test database. If you restored to non-ASM storage then you can also use
operating system commands to remove the database.
Use the DROP DATABASE command to delete all files associated with the database
automatically. The following example deletes the database files:
STARTUP FORCE NOMOUNT PFILE='?/oradata/test/inittrgta.ora';
DROP DATABASE;
Because you did not perform the restore and recovery operation when connected to the recovery
catalog, the recovery catalog contains no records for any of the restored files or the procedures
performed during the test. Likewise, the control file of the trgta database is completely unaffected
by the test.

Answer: D
Explanation:
Recovering the Database After a Disaster
The procedure for disaster recovery is similar to the procedure for recovering the database with a
backup control file in NOCATALOG mode. If you are restoring the database to a new host, then
you should also review the considerations described in "Restoring a Database on a New Host".
This scenario assumes that the Linux server on which your database was running has been
damaged beyond repair. Fortunately, you backed up the database to Oracle Secure Backup and
have the tapes available. The scenario assumes the following:
To recover the database on the new host:
1. If possible, restore or re-create all relevant network files such as tnsnames.ora and listener.ora
and a password file.
2. Start RMAN and connect to the target database instance.
At this stage, no initialization parameter file exists. If you have set ORACLE_SID and
ORACLE_HOME, then you can use operating system authentication to connect as SYSDBA. For
example, start RMAN as follows:
% rman
RMAN> CONNECT TARGET
/
3. Specify the DBID for the target database with the SET DBID command, as described in
"Restoring the Server Parameter File".
For example, enter the following command:
SET DBID 676549873;
4. Run the STARTUP NOMOUNT command.
When the server parameter file is not available, RMAN attempts to start the instance with a
dummy server parameter file.
5. Allocate a channel to the media manager and then restore the server parameter file from
autobackup. For example, enter the following command to restore the server parameter file from
Oracle Secure Backup:
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 171
RUN
{
ALLOCATE CHANNEL c1 DEVICE TYPE sbt;
RESTORE SPFILE FROM AUTOBACKUP;
}
6. Restart the instance with the restored server parameter file.
STARTUP FORCE NOMOUNT;
7. Write a command file to perform the restore and recovery operation, and then execute the
command file.
The command file should do the following:
a. Allocate a channel to the media manager.
b. Restore a control file autobackup (see "Performing Recovery with a Backup Control File and No
Recovery Catalog").
c. Mount the restored control file.
d. Catalog any backups not recorded in the repository with the CATALOG command.
e. Restore the data files to their original locations. If volume names have changed, then run SET
NEWNAME commands before the restore operation and perform a switch after the restore
operation to update the control file with the new locations for the data files, as shown in the
following example.
f. Recover the data files. RMAN stops recovery when it reaches the log sequence number
specified.
RMAN> RUN
{
# Manually allocate a channel to the media manager
ALLOCATE CHANNEL t1 DEVICE TYPE sbt;
# Restore autobackup of the control file. This example assumes that you
have
# accepted the default format for the autobackup name.
RESTORE CONTROLFILE FROM AUTOBACKUP;
# The set until command is used in case the database
# structure has changed in the most recent backups, and you want to
# recover to that point in time. In this way RMAN restores the database
# to the same structure that the database had at the specified time.
ALTER DATABASE MOUNT;
SET UNTIL SEQUENCE 1124 THREAD 1;
RESTORE DATABASE;
RECOVER DATABASE;

"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 172
}
The following example of the RUN command shows the same scenario except with new file
names for the restored data files:
RMAN> RUN
{
# If you must restore the files to new locations,
# use SET NEWNAME commands:
SET NEWNAME FOR DATAFILE 1 TO '/dev/vgd_1_0/rlvt5_500M_1';
SET NEWNAME FOR DATAFILE 2 TO '/dev/vgd_1_0/rlvt5_500M_2';
SET NEWNAME FOR DATAFILE 3 TO '/dev/vgd_1_0/rlvt5_500M_3';
ALLOCATE CHANNEL t1 DEVICE TYPE sbt;
RESTORE CONTROLFILE FROM AUTOBACKUP;
ALTER DATABASE MOUNT;
SET UNTIL SEQUENCE 124 THREAD 1;
RESTORE DATABASE;
SWITCH DATAFILE ALL; # Update control file with new location of data files.
RECOVER DATABASE;
}
8. If recovery was successful, then open the database and reset the online logs:
ALTER DATABASE OPEN RESETLOGS;

QUESTION NO: 296
You are managing an Oracle Database 11g instance. You want to create a duplicate database for
testing purpose.
What are the prerequisites for performing the active database duplication? (Choose all that apply.)
A. The source database backup must be copied over the net for test database.
B. The source database must be run in ARCHIVELOG mode if the database is open.
C. The source database must be shut down cleanly if the database is in mounted state.
D. A net service name should be set up and a listener configured with the target as well as the
source database.
Answer: B,C,D
Explanation:
To ensure that the source database is in the proper state:
1. If the source database instance is not mounted or open, then mount or open it.
2. If you are performing active database duplication, then ensure that the following additional
requirements are met:
If the source database is open, then archiving must be enabled.
If the source database is not open, then the database does not require instance recovery.
(Tips: does not require instance recovery, means you cannot shutdown the source database with
abort option, you need to shutdown it cleanly.)

Answer: A,C
Explanation:
Duplicating a Database
Overview of RMAN Database Duplication
Database duplication is the use of the DUPLICATE command to copy all or a subset of the data in
a source database. The duplicate database (the copied database) functions entirely independently
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 192
from the source database (the database being copied).
Purpose of Database Duplication
If you copy a database with operating system utilities instead of the DUPLICATE command, then
the DBID of the copied database remains the same as the original database. To register the copy
database in the same recovery catalog with the original, you must change the DBID with the
DBNEWID utility (see Oracle Database Utilities). In contrast, the DUPLICATE command
automatically assigns the duplicate database a different DBID so that it can be registered in the
same recovery catalog as the source database.
Backup-Based Duplication
In backup-based duplication, RMAN creates the duplicate database by using pre-existing RMAN
backups and copies. This technique of duplication uses one of the following mutually exclusive
subtechniques: Duplication without a target database connection, RMAN obtains metadata about
backups from a recovery catalog.
Duplication without a target database connection and without a recovery catalog. RMAN obtains
metadata about where backups and copies reside from BACKUP LOCATION.
Duplication with a target database connection. RMAN obtains metadata about backups from the
target database control file or from the recovery catalog.
How RMAN Duplicates a Database
For backup-based duplication, the principal work of the duplication is performed by the auxiliary
channels. These channels correspond to a server session on the auxiliary instance on the
destination host. For active database duplication the primary work is performed by target
channels. RMAN must perform database point-in-time recovery, even when no explicit point in
time is provided for duplication. Point-in-time recovery is required because the online redo log files
in the source database are not backed up and cannot be applied to the duplicate database. The
farthest point of recovery of the duplicate database is the most recent redo log file archived by the
source database.
As part of the duplicating operation, RMAN automates the following steps:
1. Creates a default server parameter file for the auxiliary instance if the following conditions are
true:
2. Restores from backup or copies from active database the latest control file that satisfies the
UNTIL clause requirements.
3. Mounts the restored or copied backup control file from the active database.
4. Uses the RMAN repository to select the backups for restoring the data files to the auxiliary
instance. This step applies to backup-based duplication.
5. Restores and copies the duplicate data files and recovers them with incremental backups and
archived redo log files to a noncurrent point in time.
6. Shuts down and restarts the database instance in NOMOUNT mode.
7. Creates a new control file, which then creates and stores the new DBID in the data files.

8. Opens the duplicate database with the RESETLOGS option and creates the online redo log for
the new database.

You want to take the backup of the USERS tablespace. It has a single data file of 900 MB. You
have tape drives of 300 MB each. The SBT channel is configured for the RMAN. To accomplish
the backup, you issued the following RMAN command:
RMAN> BACKUP SECTION SIZE 300M TABLESPACE users;
Which two statements are true regarding the execution of the above command? (Choose two.)
A. The RMAN parallelizes the backup although the parallelism is not set for a channel.
B. The backup piece size will be limited to 300 MB.
C. The operation is accomplished using the default channel available.
D. Three channels for the tape drive must be configured by setting the parallelism to three.
Answer: B,C
Explanation:
SECTION SIZE sizeSpec Specifies the size of each backup section produced during a data file
backup.
By setting this parameter, RMAN can create a multisection backup. In a multisection backup,
RMAN creates a backup piece that contains one file section, which is a contiguous range of blocks
in a file. All sections of a multisection backup are the same size. You can create a multisection
backup for a data file, but not a data file copy.
File sections enable RMAN to create multiple steps for the backup of a single large data file.
RMAN channels can process each step independently and in parallel, with each channel
producing one section of a multisection backup set.
If you specify a section size that is larger than the size of the file, then RMAN does not use
multisection backup for the file. If you specify a small section size that would produce more than
256 sections, then RMAN increases the section size to a value that results in exactly 256 sections.
Depending on where you specify this parameter in the RMAN syntax, you can specify different

You are managing an Oracle Database 11g database. You want to take the backup of
MULT_DATA, a big file tablespace of size 100 TB on tape drive, but you have tapedrives of only

Which method would accomplish the task quickly and efficiently?
A. parallel image copy backup
B. backup with MAXPIECESIZE configured for the channel
C. parallel backup with MAXPIECESIZE configured for the channel
D. intrafile parallel backup
Answer: D
Explanation:
The MAXPIECESIZE option is to limit the size of backup piece. not to split the big file into pieces.
Configuring the Maximum Size of Backup Pieces
Backup piece size is an issue when it exceeds the maximum file size permitted by the file system
or media management software. You can use the MAXPIECESIZE parameter of the CONFIGURE
CHANNEL or ALLOCATE CHANNEL command to limit the size of backup pieces.
For example, to limit the backup piece size to 2 gigabytes or less, you can configure the automatic
DISK channel as follows and then run BACKUP DATABASE:
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 209
CONFIGURE CHANNEL DEVICE TYPE DISK MAXPIECESIZE 2G;
BACKUP DATABASE;
We should use the SECTION SIZE option to split the big file into sections to the multiple backup
devices. SECTION SIZE sizeSpec Specifies the size of each backup section produced during a
data file backup.
By setting this parameter, RMAN can create a multisection backup. In a multisection backup,
RMAN creates a backup piece that contains one file section, which is a contiguous range of blocks
in a file. All sections of a multisection backup are the same size. You can create a multisection
backup for a data file, but not a data file copy.
File sections enable RMAN to create multiple steps for the backup of a single large data file.
RMAN channels can process each step independently and in parallel, with each channel
producing one section of a multisection backup set.
If you specify a section size that is larger than the size of the file, then RMAN does not use
multisection backup for the file. If you specify a small section size that would produce more than
256 sections, then RMAN increases the section size to a value that results in exactly 256 sections.
Depending on where you specify this parameter in the RMAN syntax, you can specify different
section sizes for different files in the same backup job.

What configuration should be effected to accomplish faster and optimized backups by using the
above command?
A. The SBT channel must be configured, with the default parallelism setting for the SBT device set
to 1.
B. The COMPATIBLE initialization parameter for the database instance must be set to at least
10.0.
C. The SBT channel must be configured, with the parallelism setting for the SBT device set to 3.
D. The SBT channel must be configured, with the MAXPIECESIZE set to 300 MB.
Answer: C
Explanation:
Dividing the Backup of a Large Data File into Sections (link)
If you specify the SECTION SIZE parameter on the BACKUP command, then RMAN creates a
backup set in which each backup piece contains the blocks from one file section. A file section is a
contiguous range of blocks in a file. This type of backup is called a multisection backup.
Note: You cannot specify SECTION SIZE with MAXPIECESIZE.
The purpose of multisection backups is to enable RMAN channels to back up a single large file in
parallel. RMAN divides the work among multiple channels, with each channel backing up one file
section in a file. Backing up a file in separate sections can improve the performance of backups of
large datafiles.
If a multisection backup completes successfully, then none of the backup sets generated during
the backup contain a partial data file. If a multisection backup is unsuccessful, then it is possible
for the RMAN metadata to contain a record for a partial backup set. RMAN does not consider
partial backups for restore and recovery. You must use the DELETE command to delete the partial
backup set.
If you specify a section size that is larger than the size of the file, then RMAN does not use
multisection backup for the file. If you specify a small section size that would produce more than
256 sections, then RMAN increases the section size to a value that results in exactly 256 sections.
To make a multisection backup:
1. Start RMAN and connect to a target database and recovery catalog (if used).
2. If necessary, configure channel parallelism so that RMAN can make the backup parallel.
3. Execute BACKUP with the SECTION SIZE parameter.

For example, suppose that the users tablespace contains a single data file of 900 MB. Also
assume that three SBT channels are configured, with the parallelism setting for the SBT device set
to 3. You can break up the data file in this tablespace into file sections as shown in the following
example:
BACKUP
SECTION SIZE 300M
TABLESPACE users;
In this example, each of the three SBT channels backs up a 300 MB file section of the users data
file.
QUESTION NO: 354
The BACKUP_TAPE_IO_SLAVES parameter is set to FALSE for the database instance.
Which statement is true while performing a tape backup in an RMAN session?
A. The tape I/O performed is asynchronous
B. The tape buffer is allocated from the System Global Area (SGA)
C. The tape buffer is allocated from the Program Global Area (PGA)
D. Oracle I/O uses an interrupt mechanism to determine when each I/O completes
Answer: C
Explanation:
Tape I/O Slaves
RMAN allocates the tape buffers in the System Global Area (SGA) or the Program Global Area
(PGA), depending on whether I/O slaves are used. If you set the initialization parameter
BACKUP_TAPE_IO_SLAVES=true, then RMAN allocates tape buffers from the SGA. Tape
devices can only be accessed by one process at a time, so RMAN starts as many slaves as
necessary for the number of tape devices. If the LARGE_POOL_SIZE initialization parameter is
also set, then RMAN allocates buffers from the large pool. If you set
BACKUP_TAPE_IO_SLAVES=false, then RMAN allocates the buffers from the PGA.
If you use I/O slaves, then set the LARGE_POOL_SIZE initialization parameter to dedicate SGA
memory to holding these large memory allocations. This parameter prevents RMAN I/O buffers
from competing with the library cache for SGA memory. If I/O slaves for tape I/O were requested
but there is not enough space in the SGA for them, slaves are not used, and a message appears
in the alert log.
The parameter BACKUP_TAPE_IO_SLAVES specifies whether RMAN uses slave processes
rather than the number of slave processes. Tape devices can only be accessed by one process at
a time, and RMAN uses the number of slaves necessary for the number of tape devices.

obsolete, as shown in Example 2-26.
You can use the KEEP syntax to generate archival database backups that satisfy business or
legal requirements. The KEEP setting is an attribute of the backup set (not individual backup
piece) or image copy.
Note: You cannot use KEEP with BACKUP BACKUPSET.
With the KEEP syntax, you can keep the backups so that they are considered obsolete after a
specified time (KEEP UNTIL), or make them never obsolete (KEEP FOREVER). As shown in
Example 2-27, you must be connected to a recovery catalog when you specify KEEP FOREVER.

Creating a Consistent Database Backup for Archival Purposes
This example uses a keepOption to create an archival backup set that cannot be considered
obsolete for one year. The example backs up the database, archives the redo in the current online
logs to ensure that this new backup is consistent, and backs up only those archived redo log files
needed to restore the data file backup to a consistent state.
The BACKUP command also creates a restore point to match the SCN at which this backup is
consistent. The FORMAT parameter must be capable of creating multiple backup pieces in
multiple backup sets.

You execute the following command to set the redundancy retention policy in Recovery Manager
(RMAN):
RMAN> CONFIGURE RETENTION POLICY TO REDUNDANCY 3;
Identify the statement that correctly describes the implications of this command.
A. when there are already three backups, for the fourth backup RMAN removes the oldest backup.
B. When there are already three backups, for the fourth backup RMAN marks the oldest backup
as obsolete.
C. the number of backups that are retained is equal to three and it includes full, incremental, and
cumulative backups.
D. when there are already three backup, one of the existing backups must be removed manually
before taking the fourth backup.
Answer: B
Explanation:
Configuring a Redundancy-Based Retention Policy
The REDUNDANCY parameter of the CONFIGURE RETENTION POLICY command specifies
how many full or level 0 backups of each data file and control file that RMAN should keep. If the
number of full or level 0 backups for a specific data file or control file exceeds the REDUNDANCY
setting, then RMAN considers the extra backups as obsolete. The default retention policy is
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 216
REDUNDANCY 1.
As you produce more backups, RMAN keeps track of which ones to retain and which are obsolete.
RMAN retains all archived logs and incremental backups that are needed to recover the
nonobsolete backups.
Assume that you make a full backup of data file 7 on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and
Thursday. You now have four full backups of this data file.If REDUNDANCY is 2, then the Monday
and Tuesday backups are obsolete. If you make another backup on Friday, then the Wednesday
backup of data file 7 becomes obsolete. Assume a different case in which REDUNDANCY is 1.
You run a level 0 database backup at noon on Monday, a level 1 cumulative backup at noon on
Tuesday and Wednesday, and a level 0 backup at noon on Thursday. Immediately after each daily
backup you run the command DELETE OBSOLETE. The Wednesday DELETE command does
not remove the Tuesday level 1 backup because this backup is not redundant: the Tuesday level 1
backup could be used to recover the Monday level 0 backup to a time between noon on Tuesday
and noon on Wednesday. However, the DELETE command on Thursday removes the previous
level 0 and level 1 backups.
Run the CONFIGURE RETENTION POLICY command at the RMAN prompt, as in the following
example: CONFIGURE RETENTION POLICY TO REDUNDANCY 3;

Answer: B
Explanation:
Table 12-2 Flashback TRANSACTION_BACKOUT Options
CASCADE
Backs out specified transactions and all dependent transactions in a post-order fashion (that is,
children are backed out before parents are backed out).
Without CASCADE, if any dependent transaction is not specified, an error occurs.
NOCASCADE
Default. Backs out specified transactions, which are expected to have no dependent transactions.
First dependent transactions causes an error and appears in *_FLASHBACK_TXN_REPORT.
NOCASCADE_FORCE
Backs out specified transactions, ignoring dependent transactions. Server runs undo SQL
statements for specified transactions in reverse order of commit times. If no constraints break and
you are satisfied with the result, you can commit the changes; otherwise, you can roll them back.
NONCONFLICT_ONLY
Backs out changes to nonconflicting rows of the specified transactions. Database remains
consistent, but transaction atomicity is lost.

11:00:00','YYYY-MMDD HH24:MI:SS');
Which two statements are correct? (Choose two.)
A. The emp table that was dropped by mistake earlier is restored.
B. The FLASHBACK TABLE statement is executed as a single transaction.
C. The FLASHBACK TABLE statement does not maintain existing indexes on the emp table.
D. The changes made to the emp table since the specified time are undone if no constraint is
violated during flashback.
Answer: B,D
Explanation:
FLASHBACK TABLE (Link)
Purpose
Use the FLASHBACK TABLE statement to restore an earlier state of a table in the event of human
or application error. The time in the past to which the table can be flashed back is dependent on
the amount of undo data in the system. Also, Oracle Database cannot restore a table to an earlier
state across any DDL operations that change the structure of the table.
Semantics
During an Oracle Flashback Table operation, Oracle Database acquires exclusive DML locks on
all the tables specified in the Flashback list. These locks prevent any operations on the tables
while they are reverting to their earlier state.
The Flashback Table operation is executed in a single transaction, regardless of the number of
tables specified in the Flashback list. Either all of the tables revert to the earlier state or none of
them do. If the Flashback Table operation fails on any table, then the entire statement fails.
At the completion of the Flashback Table operation, the data in table is consistent with table at the
earlier time.
However, FLASHBACK TABLE TO SCN or TIMESTAMP does not preserve rowids, and
FLASHBACK TABLE
TO BEFORE DROP does not recover referential constraints.
Oracle Database does not revert statistics associated with table to their earlier form. Indexes on
table that exist currently are reverted and reflect the state of the table at the Flashback point. If the
index exists now but did not yet exist at the Flashback point, then the database updates the index
to reflect the state of the table at the Flashback point. However, indexes that were dropped during
the interval between the Flashback point and the current time are not restored.
Logical Flashback Features Useful in Backup and Recovery (Link)
The remaining flashback features operate at the logical level. The logical features documented in
this chapter are as follows:
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 242
You can recover a table or set of tables to a specified point in time in the past without taking any
part of the database offline. In many cases, Flashback Table eliminates the need to perform more
complicated point-in-time recovery operations. Flashback Table restores tables while automatically
maintaining associated attributes such as current indexes, triggers and constraints, and not
requiring you to find and restore application-specific properties.
"Rewinding a Table with Flashback Table" explains how to use this feature.
You can reverse the effects of a DROP TABLE statement.
"Rewinding a DROP TABLE Operation with Flashback Drop" explains how to use this feature.
Note:
Because the logical flashback features have uses not specific to backup and recovery, some
documentation for them is located elsewhere in the documentation set.
All logical flashback features except Flashback Drop rely on undo data. Used primarily for
providing read consistency for SQL queries and rolling back transactions, undo records contain
the information required to reconstruct data as it existed at a past time and examine the record of
changes since that past time.

Answer: A,B
Explanation:
About Health Monitor Checks
Health Monitor checks (also known as checkers, health checks, or checks) examine various layers
and components of the database. Health checks detect file corruptions, physical and logical block
corruptions, undo and redo corruptions, data dictionary corruptions, and more. The health checks
generate reports of their findings and, in many cases, recommendations for resolving problems.
Health checks can be run in two ways:
Health Monitor checks store findings, recommendations, and other information in the Automatic
Diagnostic Repository (ADR).
Health checks can run in two modes:
All the health checks can be run in DB-online mode. Only the Redo Integrity Check and the DB
Structure Integrity Check can be used in DB-offline mode.
Types of Health Checks:
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 250
Health monitor runs the following checks:
Verifies the contents of dictionary entries for each dictionary object. Performs a cross-row level
check, which verifies that logical constraints on rows in the dictionary are enforced.
Performs an object relationship check, which verifies that parent-child relationships between
dictionary objects are enforced.
The Dictionary Integrity Check operates on the following dictionary objects:
tab$, clu$, fet$, uet$, seg$, undo$, ts$, file$, obj$, ind$, icol$, col$, user$, con$, cdef$, ccol$,
bootstrap$, objauth$, ugroup$, tsq$, syn$, view$, typed_view$, superobj$, seq$, lob$, coltype$,

Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 259
Answer: B
Explanation:
Incident packaging service (IPS) and incident packages
The IPS enables you to automatically and easily gather the diagnostic data?traces, dumps,
health check reports, and more?pertaining to a critical error and package the data into a zip file
for transmission to Oracle Support. Because all diagnostic data relating to a critical error are
tagged with that error's incident number, you do not have to search through trace files and other
files to determine the files that are required for analysis; the incident packaging service identifies
the required files automatically and adds them to the zip file.
Before creating the zip file, the IPS first collects diagnostic data into an intermediate logical
structure called an incident package (package). Packages are stored in the Automatic Diagnostic
Repository. If you choose to, you can access this intermediate logical structure, view and modify
its contents, add or remove additional diagnostic data at any time, and when you are ready, create
the zip file from the package. After these steps are completed, the zip file is ready to be uploaded
to Oracle Support.

Which of the following is NOT an advantage of block media recovery (BMR)?
A. Reduced MTTR.
B. Datafiles remain offline while corrupt blocks are repaired.
C. Datafiles remain online while corrupt blocks are repaired.
D. A and C
Answer: B
Explanation:
Overview of Block Media Recovery (link)
Purpose of Block Media Recovery
You can use block media recovery to recover one or more corrupt data blocks within a data file.
Block media recovery provides the following advantages over data file media recovery:
Without block media recovery, if even a single block is corrupt, then you must take the data file
offline and restore a backup of the data file. You must apply all redo generated for the data file
after the backup was created. The entire file is unavailable until media recovery completes. With
block media recovery, only the blocks actually being recovered are unavailable during the
recovery.
Block media recovery is most useful for physical corruption problems that involve a small, wellknown
number of blocks. Block-level data loss usually results from intermittent, random I/O errors
that do not cause widespread data loss, and memory corruptions that are written to disk. Block
media recovery is not intended for cases where the extent of data loss or corruption is unknown
and the entire data file requires recovery. In such cases, data file media recovery is the best
solution.
QUESTION NO: 437
Which of the following are correct about block media recovery? (Choose all that apply.)
A. Physical and logical block corruption is recorded automatically in
V$DATABASE_BLOCK_CORRUPTION.
B. Logical corruptions are repairable by BMR.

E. ARCHIVELOG mode is not required if you have both a full and incremental backup for restore.

Answer: A,C
Explanation:
Overview of Block Media Recovery (link)
Basic Concepts of Block Media Recovery
Whenever block corruption has been automatically detected, you can perform block media
recovery manually with the RECOVER ... BLOCK command. By default, RMAN first searches for
good blocks in the real-time query physical standby database, then flashback logs and then blocks
in full or level 0 incremental backups.
Identification of Corrupt Blocks
The block has a valid checksum, the header and footer match, and so on, but the contents are
logically inconsistent. Block media recovery may not be able to repair all logical block corruptions.
In these cases, alternate recovery methods, such as tablespace point-in-time recovery, or
dropping and re-creating the affected objects, may repair the corruption. Logical corruption
checking is disabled by default. You can turn it on by specifying the CHECK LOGICAL option of
the BACKUP, RESTORE, RECOVER, and VALIDATE commands.
The database can detect some corruptions by validating relationships between blocks and
segments, but cannot detect them by a check of an individual block. The
V$DATABASE_BLOCK_CORRUPTION view does not record at this level of granularity.
Prerequisites for Block Media Recovery (link)
The following prerequisites apply to the RECOVER ... BLOCK command:
If only proxy copy backups exist, then you can restore them to a nondefault location on disk, in
which case RMAN considers them data file copies and searches them for blocks during block
media recovery.
If flashback logging is enabled and contains older, uncorrupted versions of the corrupt blocks, then
RMAN can use these blocks, possibly speeding up the recovery.

Fault Diagnosability Infrastructure Overview
The fault diagnosability infrastructure aids in preventing, detecting, diagnosing, and resolving
problems. The problems that are targeted in particular are critical errors such as those caused by
code bugs, metadata corruption, and customer data corruption.
When a critical error occurs, it is assigned an incident number, and diagnostic data for the error
(such as trace files) are immediately captured and tagged with this number. The data is then
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 270
stored in the Automatic Diagnostic Repository (ADR)?a file-based repository outside the
database?where it can later be retrieved by incident number and analyzed.
About Incidents and Problems
A problem is a critical error in a database instance, Oracle Automatic Storage Management
(Oracle ASM) instance, or other Oracle product or component. Critical errors manifest as internal
errors, such as ORA- 00600, or other severe errors, such as ORA-07445 (operating system
exception) or ORA-04031 (out of memory in the shared pool). Problems are tracked in the ADR.
Each problem has a problem key, which is a text string that describes the problem. It includes an
error code (such as ORA 600) and in some cases, one or more error parameters.
An incident is a single occurrence of a problem. When a problem (critical error) occurs multiple
times, an incident is created for each occurrence. Incidents are timestamped and tracked in the
Automatic Diagnostic Repository (ADR). Each incident is identified by a numeric incident ID, which
is unique within the ADR. When an incident occurs, the database:

About Quick Packaging and Custom Packaging
The Enterprise Manager Support Workbench provides two methods for creating and uploading an
incident package: the quick packaging method and the custom packaging method.
Quick Packaging?This is the more automated method with a minimum of steps, organized in a
guided workflow (a wizard). You select a single problem, provide a package name and description,
and then schedule upload of the package contents, either immediately or at a specified date and
time. The Support Workbench automatically places diagnostic data related to the problem into the
package, finalizes the package, creates the zip file, and then uploads the file. With this method,
you do not have the opportunity to add, edit, or remove package files or add other diagnostic data
such as SQL test cases. However, it is the simplest and quickest way to get first-failure diagnostic
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 271
data to Oracle Support. Quick packaging is the method used in the workflow described in
"Investigating, Reporting, and Resolving a Problem".
Note that when quick packaging is complete, the package that was created by the wizard remains.
You can then modify the package with custom packaging operations at a later time and manually
reupload.
Custom Packaging?This is the more manual method, with more steps. It is intended for expert
Support Workbench users who want more control over the packaging process. With custom
packaging, you can create a new package with one or more problems, or you can add one or
more problems to an existing package. You can then perform a variety of operations on the new or
updated package, including:
You might conduct these operations over a number of days, before deciding that you have enough
diagnostic information to send to Oracle Support.
With custom packaging, you create the zip file and request upload to Oracle Support as two
separate steps. Each of these steps can be performed immediately or scheduled for a future date
and time.
Select the Full or Incremental option to generate a full package zip file or an incremental package
zip file.
For a full package zip file, all the contents of the package (original contents and all correlated data)
are always added to the zip file.
For an incremental package zip file, only the diagnostic information that is new or modified since
the last time that you created a zip file for the same package is added to the zip file. For example,
if trace information was appended to a trace file since that file was last included in the generated
physical file for a package, the trace file is added to the incremental package zip file. Conversely, if
no changes were made to a trace file since it was last uploaded for a package, that trace file is not
included in the incremental package zip file.

Topic 15, Managing Database Performance
QUESTION NO: 494
While deploying a new application module, the software vendor ships the application software
along with appropriate SQL plan baselines for the new SQLs being introduced. Which two
statements describe the consequences? (Choose two.)
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 296
A. The plan baselines can be evolved over time to produce better performance.
B. The newly generated plans are directly placed into the SQL plan baseline without being
verified.
C. The new SQL statements initially run with the plans that are known to produce good
performance under standard test configuration.
D. The optimizer does not generate new plans for the SQL statements for which the SQL plan
baseline has been imported.
Answer: A,C
Explanation:
Purpose of SQL Plan Baselines
Common scenarios where SQL plan management can improve or preserve SQL performance
include:
A database upgrade that installs a new optimizer version usually results in plan changes for a
small percentage of SQL statements. Most of these plan changes result in either no performance
change or improvement. However, some plan changes may cause performance regressions. SQL
plan baselines significantly minimize potential regressions resulting from an upgrade.
Ongoing system and data changes can impact plans for some SQL statements, potentially
causing performance regressions. SQL plan baselines help minimize performance regressions
and stabilize SQL performance.
Deployment of new application modules means introducing new SQL statements into the
database. The application software may use appropriate SQL execution plans developed in a
standard test configuration for the new statements. If the system configuration is significantly
different from the test configuration, then the database can evolve SQL plan baselines over time to
produce better performance.

You plan to have a larger moving window size for the default system-defined moving window
baseline because you want to use the adaptive threshold.
Which statement factors in this consideration while increasing the size of the moving window?
A. The collection level for the AWR should be set to BASIC.
B. The moving window size must be less than Undo Retention.
C. The moving window size should be greater than the Automatic Workload Repository (AWR)
retention period.
D. The moving window size should be equal to or less than the Automatic Workload Repository
(AWR) retention period.
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 297
Answer: D
Explanation:
Moving Window Baseline (link)
A moving window baseline corresponds to all AWR data that exists within the AWR retention
period. This is useful when using adaptive thresholds because the database can use AWR data in
the entire AWR retention period to compute metric threshold values.
Oracle Database automatically maintains a system-defined moving window baseline. The default
window size for the system-defined moving window baseline is the current AWR retention period,
which by default is 8 days.
If you are planning to use adaptive thresholds, consider using a larger moving window?such as
30 days?to accurately compute threshold values. You can resize the moving window baseline by
changing the number of days in the moving window to a value that is equal to or less than the
number of days in the AWR retention period. Therefore, to increase the size of a moving window,
you must first increase the AWR retention period accordingly.
QUESTION NO: 496
View the Exhibit that sets the threshold for the Current Open Cursors Count metric. Why is the

Which two statements are true regarding hot patching? (Choose two.)
A. It requires relinking of the Oracle binary.
B. It does not require database instance shutdown.
C. It can detect conflicts between two online patches.
D. It is available for installing all patches on all platforms.
E. It works only in a single database instance environment.
Answer: B,C
Explanation:
Online Patching
Regular patches typically contain .o (object) files and/or .a (archive) libraries, and therefore require
a relink of the RDBMS binary. Online patches, however, contain .so files, which are
dynamic/shared libraries, and do not require a relink of the RDBMS binary. Consequently, since a
relink is not needed, you can apply or roll back online patches while the RDBMS instance is
running. This simplifies administration, because no downtime is needed, and also results in a
much quicker turnaround time for installing or de-installing Online Patches.
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 299
A regular RDBMS patch can require many minutes to install, since it requires instance shutdown,
a relink, and instance startup. On the other hand, you can install an online patch in just a few
seconds.
Online patches are only applicable for Oracle RDBMS and not any other products. Online patches
are currently supported on the following Windows and UNIX platforms for version 11.2.0.1.0 and
later:
About Patch Conflicts:
All patches may not be compatible with one another. For example, if you apply a patch, all the
bugs the patch fixes could reappear after you apply another patch. This is called a conflict
situation. OPatch detects such situations and raises an error when it detects a conflict.

Which of the following identifies and creates an index to minimize the DB time for a particular SQL
statement?
A. The SGA Tuning Advisor
B. The SQL Access Advisor
C. The SQL Tuning Advisor
D. The Memory Advisor
Answer: C
Explanation:
The SQL Access Advisor allows the DBA to gather global recommendations for a workload. The
SQL Tuning advisor is more granular, tuning a single statement.
The main functions of the SQL Access advisor is to recommend missing indexes and materialized
views, but a comprehensive task analysis will also create SQL Profiles that can be used within the
SQL Tuning advisor. The DBA defines the SQL used in the SQL Access Advisor task, and can
choose current SQL, a user-defined set of SQL, a historical workload, or a hypothetical workload.
A hypothetical workload is very useful because the DBA need-only specify the tables that
participate in the queries, and the SQL Access Advisor gathers the appropriate SQL statements to
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 305
create the workload. The SQL Tuning Advisor (STA) is primarily designed to replace the manual
tuning of SQL statements and speed up the overall SQL tuning process. The SQL Tuning Advisor
studies poorly executing SQL statements and evaluates resource consumption in terms of CPU,
I/O, and temporary space.
The SQL Tuning Advisor (STA) works with the Automatic Tuning Optimizer (ATO) to analyze
historical SQL workload using data from the AWR, and it generates recommendations for new
indexes and materialized views that will reduce the disk I/O associated with troublesome SQL
statements.

Determining Single Column Statistics
A good example of correlated or related columns are the country_id and cust_state_province
columns in the CUSTOMERS_OBE table. When the value of cust_state_province is 'CA' , the
value of country_id is 'US'. There is a skew in the data in these two columns, which means the
majority of rows in the table have the values 'CA' and 'US'. Both the relationship between the
columns and the skew in the data make it difficult for the optimizer to calculate the selectivity or
cardinality of these columns correctly when they are used together in a query. Extended statistics
should help in this situation.

Which of the following is a potential performance tuning recommendation from the SQL Access
Advisor?
A. Create new indexes.
B. Modify existing indexes.
C. Implement partitioning on a nonpartitioned table.
D. Create materialized views.
E. All of the above
Answer: E
Explanation:
18.1 Overview of SQL Access Advisor
Materialized views, partitions, and indexes are essential when tuning a database to achieve
optimum performance for complex, data-intensive queries. SQL Access Advisor helps you achieve
your performance goals by recommending the proper set of materialized views, materialized view
logs, partitions, and indexes for a given workload. Understanding and using these structures is
essential when optimizing SQL as they can result in significant performance improvements in data
retrieval. The advantages, however, do not come without a cost. Creation and maintenance of
these objects can be time consuming, and space requirements can be significant. In particular,
partitioning of an unpartitioned base table is a complex operation that must be planned carefully.
QUESTION NO: 519

Identify the two direct sources from where SQL plans can be loaded into the SQL plan baselines.
(Choose two.)
A. Cursor cache
B. Stored outline
C. SQL Tuning Set
D. Automatic Workload Repository (AWR) snapshots
Answer: A,C
Explanation:
The AWR snapshots needs to be loaded to STS at first, then load to SQL plan.
--------------------------------------------------------------- ( Link)
You can perform manual plan loading by:
Loading Plans from SQL Tuning Sets and AWR Snapshots
To load plans from a SQL tuning set, use the LOAD_PLANS_FROM_SQLSET function of the
DBMS_SPM package.
The following example loads the plans stored in the SQL tuning set named tset1:
DECLARE
my_plans PLS_INTEGER;
BEGIN
my_plans := DBMS_SPM.LOAD_PLANS_FROM_SQLSET( sqlset_name => 'tset1');
END;
/
To load plans from Automatic Workload Repository (AWR), load the plans stored in AWR
snapshots into a SQL tuning set before using the LOAD_PLANS_FROM_SQLSET function as
described in this section.
Loading Plans from the Shared SQL Area
To load plans from the shared SQL area, use the LOAD_PLANS_FROM_CURSOR_CACHE
function of the DBMS_SPM package. In the following example, Oracle Database loads the plans
located in the shared SQL area for the SQL statement identified by its sql_id:

parameter-optimizer (exhibit):
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 319
A. The optimizer uses a new plan because none of the plans in the exhibit2 are fixed plans.
B. The optimizer uses the plan in the second row of the exhibit2 because it is an accepted plan.
C. The optimizer uses the plan in the first row of the exhibit2 because it is the latest generated
plan.
D. The optimizer uses the plan in the first row of the exhibit2 because OPTIMIZER_MODE was set
to FIRST_ROW during its creation.
Answer: B
Explanation:
Setting the OPTIMIZER_MODE Initialization Parameter(Link)
The OPTIMIZER_MODE initialization parameter establishes the default behavior for choosing an
optimization approach for the instance.
OPTIMIZER_MODE Initialization Parameter Values
Note that using heuristics sometimes leads the optimizer to generate a plan with a cost that is
significantly larger than the cost of a plan without applying the heuristic. FIRST_ROWS is available
for backward compatibility and plan stability; use FIRST_ROWS_n instead.

C. The importance of SQL statements is based on the size of the objects accessed.
D. It generates recommendations to run SQL Tuning Advisor to tune regressed SQLs.
E. It shows only the overall impact on workload and not the net SQL impact on workload.
Answer: A,B,D
Explanation:
Introduction to SQL Performance Analyzer (link)
SQL Performance Analyzer compares the performance of SQL statements before and after the
change and produces a report identifying any changes in execution plans or performance of the
SQL statements.
Fixing Regressed SQL Statements
If the performance analysis performed by SQL Performance Analyzer reveals regressed SQL
statements, then you can make changes to remedy the problem. For example, you can fix
regressed SQL by running SQL Tuning Advisor or using SQL plan baselines. You can then repeat
the process of executing the SQL statements and comparing its performance to the first execution.
Repeat these steps until you are satisfied with the outcome of the analysis
QUESTION NO: 535
You work in a data warehouse environment that involves the execution of complex queries. The
current content of the SQL cache contains the ideal workload for analysis. You want to analyze
only a few most resource-intensive statements.
What must you do to receive recommendations on efficient use of indexes and materialized views
to improve query performance?
A. Run the SQL Access Advisor.
B. Run the SQ; Tuning Advisor (STA).
C. Run the Automatic Workload Repository (AWR) report.
D. Run the Automatic Database Diagnostic Monitor (ADDM).
Answer: A
Explanation:
In addition, SQL Access Advisor can recommend partitioning on an existing unpartitioned base
table to improve performance. Furthermore, it may recommend new indexes and materialized
views that are themselves partitioned. While creating new partitioned indexes and materialized
view is no different from the unpartitioned case, partitioning existing base tables should be
executed with care. This is especially true when indexes, views, constraints, or triggers are
defined on the table. See "Special Considerations when Script Includes Partitioning
Recommendations" for a list of issues involving base table partitioning for performing this task

A. It is loaded with the FIXED status.
B. It is loaded with the ACCEPTED status.
C. It is not loaded with the ENABLED status.
D. It is not loaded with the ACCEPTED status.
Answer: B
Explanation:
You can create SQL plan baselines by manually loading existing plans for a set of SQL statements

The OPTIMIZER_USE_PLAN_BASELINES parameter is set to TRUE. The optimizer generates a
plan for a SQL statement but does not find a matching plan in the SQL plan baseline.
Which two operations are performed by the optimizer in this scenario? (Choose two.)
A. The optimizer adds the new plan to the plan history.
B. The optimizer selects the new plan for the execution of the SQL statement.
C. The optimizer adds the new plan to the SQL plan baseline as an accepted plan.
D. The optimizer adds the new plan to the SQL plan baseline but not in the ENABLED state.
E. The optimizer costs each of the accepted plans in the SQL plan baseline and picks the one with
the lowest cost.
Answer: A,E
Explanation:
15.2.2 Selecting SQL Plan Baselines
During the SQL plan baseline selection phase, Oracle Database detects plan changes based on
the stored plan history, and selects plans to avoid potential performance regressions for a set of
SQL statements.
Each time the database compiles a SQL statement, the optimizer does the following:
1. Uses a cost-based search method to build a best-cost plan
2. Tries to find a matching plan in the SQL plan baseline
3. Does either of the following depending on whether a match is found:
The best-cost plan found by the optimizer that does not match any plans in the plan history for the
SQL statement represents a new plan. The database adds this plan as a nonaccepted plan to the
plan history. The database does not use the new plan until it is verified to not cause a performance
regression. However, if a change in the system (such as a dropped index) causes all accepted
plans to become non-reproducible, then the optimizer selects the best-cost plan. Thus, the
presence of a SQL plan baseline causes the optimizer to use conservative plan selection strategy
for the SQL statement.
To enable the use of SQL plan baselines, set the OPTIMIZER_USE_SQL_PLAN_BASELINES
initialization parameter to TRUE (default).
A SQL plan baseline contains one or more accepted plans.
The plan history is the set of plans, both accepted and not accepted, that the optimizer generates
for a SQL statement over time, the plans in the baseline form a subset of the plan history. For
example, after the optimizer generates the first acceptable plan for a SQL plan baseline,
subsequent plans are part of the plan history but not part of the plan baseline.

NFS.
E. Oracle Disk Manager can manage NFS on its own, without using the operating system kernel
NFS driver.
Answer: A,E
Explanation:
Direct NFS provides faster performance that what can be provided by the operating system's NFS
driver as Oracle bypasses the operating system and generates exactly the requests it needs (no
user configuration or tuning required). Data is cached just once in user space, which saves
memory (no second copy in kernel space). Performance is further improved by load balancing
across multiple network interfaces (if available).
QUESTION NO: 554
Which three are the valid statements in relation to SQL plan baselines? (Choose three.)
A. The plans can be manually loaded to the SQL plan baseline.
B. The plans in the SQL plan baseline are verified and accepted plans.
C. The plans generated for every SQL statement are stored in the SQL plan baseline by default.
D. The plan baselines are stored temporarily in the memory as long as the database instance is
running.
E. For the SQL plan baselines to be accessible to the optimizer, the SYSAUX tablespace must be
online.
Answer: A,B,E
Explanation:
The SQL management base (SMB), which is part of the data dictionary, stores the SQL plan
baselines and plan history in the SYSAUX tablespace. The SMB also contains SQL profiles. The
SMB uses automatic space management.
Capturing SQL Plan Baselines (refer to here).
You can configure the SQL Plan Baseline Capture phase for automatic capture of plan history and
SQL plan baselines for repeatable SQL statements. Alternatively, you can manually load plans as
SQL plan baselines.
Not all the new generated SQL plan can be accepted, so that all SQL plan stored in the plan
history, only after evolving the plans in the plan history, it becomes in the plan baseline.
You can evolve an existing SQL plan baseline by manually loading plans from the shared SQL
area or from a SQL tuning set. When you manually load plans into a SQL plan baseline, the
database adds these loaded plans as accepted plans.

QUESTION NO: 555
You run the SQL Tuning Advisor (STA) to tune a SQL statement that is part of a fixed SQL plan
baseline. The STA generates a SQL profile for the SQL statement, which recommends that you
accept the profile.
Which statement is true when you accept the suggested SQL profile?
A. The tuned plan is not added to the SQL plan baseline.
B. The tuned plan is added to the fixed SQL plan baseline as a fixed plan.
C. The tuned plan is added to the fixed SQL plan baseline as a nonfixed plan.
D. The tuned plan is added to a new nonfixed SQL plan baseline as a nonfixed plan.
Answer: C
Explanation:
15.4 Using Fixed SQL Plan Baselines (Refer to here)
When you tune a SQL statement with a fixed SQL plan baseline using SQL Tuning Advisor, a SQL
profile recommendation has special meaning. When the SQL profile is accepted, the database
adds the tuned plan to the fixed SQL plan baseline as a non-fixed plan. However, as described
above, the optimizer does not use the tuned plan when a reproducible fixed plan is present.
Therefore, the benefit of SQL tuning may not be realized. To enable the use of the tuned plan,
manually alter the tuned plan to a fixed plan by setting its FIXED attribute to YES.

Answer: A,C,D,E
Explanation:
18.1 Overview of SQL Access Advisor
Materialized views, partitions, and indexes are essential when tuning a database to achieve
optimum performance for complex, data-intensive queries. SQL Access Advisor helps you achieve
your performance goals by recommending the proper set of materialized views, materialized view
logs, partitions, and indexes for a given workload. Understanding and using these structures is
essential when optimizing SQL as they can result in significant performance improvements in data
retrieval. The advantages, however, do not come without a cost. Creation and maintenance of
these objects can be time consuming, and space requirements can be significant. In particular,
partitioning of an unpartitioned base table is a complex operation
that must be planned carefully.

Which statements are true regarding the system-defined moving window baseline in Oracle
Database 11g? (Choose all that apply.)
A. It does not allow you to change the moving window size.
B. Adaptive threshold functionalities use it by default to compute statistics.
C. It is created by default with the window size being equal to the AWR retention time.
D. It is created when the first snapshot is collected by the Automatic Workload Repository (AWR).
Answer: B,C
Explanation:
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 337
A moving window baseline corresponds to all AWR data that exists within the AWR retention
period. This is useful when using adaptive thresholds because the database can use AWR data in
the entire AWR retention period to compute metric threshold values.
Oracle Database automatically maintains a system-defined moving window baseline. The default
window size for the system-defined moving window baseline is the current AWR retention period,
which by default is 8 days. If you are planning to use adaptive thresholds, consider using a larger
moving window?such as 30 days?to accurately compute threshold values. You can resize the
moving window baseline by changing the number of days in the moving window to a value that is
equal to or less than the number of days in the AWR retention period. Therefore, to increase the
size of a moving window, you must first increase the AWR retention period accordingly.

D. adding tuned SQL plans into the SQL plan baseline
E. tuning each SQL statement in the order of importance

Answer: A,B,C,E
Explanation:
17.2.1 How Automatic SQL Tuning Works (link)
Oracle Database automatically runs SQL Tuning Advisor on selected high-load SQL statements
from the Automatic Workload Repository (AWR) that qualify as tuning candidates. This task, called
Automatic SQL Tuning, runs in the default maintenance windows on a nightly basis. By default,
automatic SQL tuning runs for at most one hour. You can customize attributes of the maintenance
windows, including start and end time, frequency, and days of the week.
After automatic SQL tuning begins, the database performs the following steps:
1. Identifies SQL candidates in the AWR for tuning
Oracle Database analyzes statistics in AWR and generates a list of potential SQL statements that
are eligible for tuning. These statements include repeating high-load statements that have a
significant impact on the database.
The database tunes only SQL statements that have an execution plan with a high potential for
improvement. The database ignores recursive SQL and statements that have been tuned recently
(in the last month), parallel queries, DML, DDL, and SQL statements with performance problems
caused by concurrency issues.The database orders the SQL statements that are selected as
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 339
candidates based on their performance impact. The database calculates the impact by summing
the CPU time and the I/O times in AWR for the selected statement in the past week.
2. Tunes each SQL statement individually by calling SQL Tuning Advisor
During the tuning process, the database considers and reports all recommendation types, but it
can implement only SQL profiles automatically.
3. Tests SQL profiles by executing the SQL statement
If a SQL profile is recommended, the database tests the new profile by executing the SQL
statement both with and without the profile. If the performance improvement improves at least
threefold, then the database accepts the SQL profile, but only if the ACCEPT_SQL_PROFILES
task parameter is set to TRUE. Otherwise, the automatic SQL tuning reports merely report the
recommendation to create a SQL profile.
4. Optionally, implements the SQL profiles provided they meet the criteria of threefold performance
improvement The database considers other factors when deciding whether to implement the SQL
profile. For example, the database does not implement a profile when the objects referenced in the
statement have stale optimizer statistics. SQL profiles that have been implemented automatically
show type is AUTO in the DBA_SQL_PROFILES view.
If the database uses SQL plan management, and if a SQL plan baseline exists for the SQL
statement, then the database adds a new plan baseline when creating the SQL profile. As a result,
the optimizer uses the new plan immediately after profile creation. See Chapter 15, "Using SQL
Plan Management". At any time during or after the automatic SQL tuning process, you can view
the results using the automatic SQL tuning report. This report describes in detail all the SQL
statements that were analyzed, the recommendations generated, and the SQL profiles that were
automatically implemented.

Answer: C,E
Explanation:
9.3 Workload Capture Restrictions
Certain types of user sessions and client requests may sometimes be captured in a workload, but
they are not supported by Database Replay. Capturing these session and request types in a
workload may result in errors during workload replay.
The following types of user sessions and client requests are not supported by Database Replay:
OBJECT_ID
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 342
Typically, Database Replay refrains from capturing these types of non-supported user sessions
and client requests. Even when they are captured, Database Replay will not replay them.
Therefore, it is usually not necessary to manually filter out non-supported user sessions and client
requests. In cases where they are captured and found to cause errors during replay, consider
using workload capture filters to exclude them from the workload.

Which statement is true regarding online redefinition for the migration of BasicFile LOBs to
SecureFile LOBs?
A. It cannot be done in parallel.

C. It does not require additional storage because the operation is done online.
D. Local and global indexes are maintained automatically during the operation.
Answer: B
Explanation:
Refer to here
Compatibility and Upgrading
All features described in this document are enabled with compatibility set to 11.2.0.0.0 or higher.
There is no downgrade capability after 11.2.0.0.0 is set.
If you want to upgrade BasicFiles LOBs to SecureFiles LOBs, you must use typical methods for
upgrading data (CTAS/ITAS, online redefinition, export/import, column to column copy, or using a
view and a new column). Most of these solutions require twice the disk space used by the data in
the input LOB column. However, partitioning and taking these actions on a partition-by-partition
basis lowers the disk space requirements.
Migrating Columns from BasicFiles LOBs to SecureFiles LOBs
The method of migrating LOBs columns is presented in this section.
Preventing Generation of REDO Space when Migrating to SecureFiles LOBs
Generation of redo space can cause performance problems during the process of migrating
BasicFiles LOB columns. Redo changes for the table are logged during the migration process only
if the table has LOGGING set.
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 343
Redo changes for the column being converted from BasicFiles LOB to SecureFiles LOB are
logged only if the storage characteristics of the SecureFiles LOB column indicate LOGGING. The
logging setting (LOGGING or NOLOGGING) for the LOB column is inherited from the tablespace
in which the LOB is created.
To prevent generation of redo space during migration make sure that you specify the
NOLOGGING storage parameter for the new SecureFiles LOB column(s). You can turn LOGGING
on once your migration is complete.
Online Redefinition for BasicFiles LOBs
Online redefinition is the only recommended method for migration of BasicFiles LOBs to
SecureFiles LOBs. It can be done at the table or partition level.

You need to perform an online table redefinition of an existing SALES table to partition it into two
tablespaces TBS1 and TBS2. The SALES table has a materialized view, materialized log, indexes,
referential integrity constraint, and triggers with the PRECEDES clause existing on it.
What action is required for dependent objects when you perform online table redefinition?
A. The dependent materialized view should have a complete refresh performed after the online
table redefinition process.
B. Triggers with the PRECEDES clause should be disabled before the online table redefinition
process.
C. Referential integrity constraints must be manually enabled after the online table redefinition
process.
D. The materialized log should be dropped before the online table redefinition process.
Answer: A
Explanation:
When performing the online table redefinition, you will:
Copy dependent objects (such as triggers, indexes, materialized view logs, grants, and
constraints) and statistics from the table being redefined to the interim table, using one of the
following two methods. Method 1 is the preferred method because it is more automatic, but there
may be times that you would choose to use method 2. Method 1 also enables you to copy table
statistics to the interim table.
Results of the Redefinition Process (link)
The following are the end results of the redefinition process:
Note:
If no registration is done or no automatic copying is done, then you must manually rename the
dependent
objects.
The referential constraints involving the interim table now involve the redefined table and are
enabled. Any indexes, triggers, materialized view logs, grants, and constraints defined on the
original table (prior to redefinition) are transferred to the interim table and are dropped when the
user drops the interim table. Any referential constraints involving the original table before the
redefinition now involve the interim table and are disabled.

Which statements are true regarding SecureFile LOBs? (Choose all that apply.)
A. The amount of undo retained is user controlled.
B. SecureFile LOBs can be used only for nonpartitioned tables.
C. Fragmentation is minimized by using variable-sized chunks dynamically.
D. SecureFile encryption allows for random reads and writes of the encrypted data.
E. It automatically detects duplicate LOB data and conserves space by storing only one copy.
Answer: C,D,E
Explanation:
One of the new feature of Oracle 11g is that Oracle SecureFiles use variable chunk sizes, which
can be as large as 64 MB.By storing these chunks next to one another, Oracle also minimizes
fragmentation.
About Deduplication
SecureFiles Intelligent Deduplication, available with the Oracle Advanced Compression Option,
enables Oracle Database to automatically detect duplicate LOB data within a LOB column or
partition, and conserve space by storing only one copy of the data.
Note that you must have a license for the Oracle Advanced Compression Option before
implementing SecureFiles Intelligent Deduplication. See Oracle Database Licensing Information
for more information.
Note also that Oracle Streams does not support SecureFiles LOBs that are deduplicated.
About Encryption
SecureFiles Intelligent Encryption, available with the Oracle Advanced Security Option, introduces
a new encryption facility for LOBs. The data is encrypted using Transparent Data Encryption
(TDE), which allows the data to be stored securely, and still allows for random read and write
access.

DB_SECUREFILE specifies whether or not to treat LOB files as SecureFiles.
Values:
NEVER
Any LOBs that are specified as SecureFiles are created as BasicFile LOBs. All SecureFile-specific
storage options and features (for example, compress, encrypt, deduplicate) will cause an
exception. The BasicFile LOB defaults will be used for storage options not specified.
PERMITTED
LOBs are allowed to be created as SecureFiles.
ALWAYS
Attempts to create all LOBs as SecureFile LOBs but creates any LOBs not in an Automatic
Segment Space Managed tablespace as BasicFile LOBs, unless SECUREFILE is explicitly
specified. Any BasicFile LOB storage options that are specified will be ignored and the SecureFile
defaults will be used for all storage options not specified.
IGNORE
The SECUREFILE keyword and all SecureFile options are ignored.

The issue is resolved by increasing the space quota on the USERS tablespace for the user. But
the user may perform such transaction in the future. You want to ensure that the command waits
rather than produce an error when such an event occurs the next time.
What can you do to achieve this before running the command in the future?
A. Set RESUMABLE_TIMEOUT for the instance.
B. Set the RESOURCE_LIMIT Parameter to TRUE.
C. Enable the database instance to use asynchronous commit.
D. Set the LOG_CHECKPOINT_TIMEOUT parameter to a nonzero value for the database
instance.
Answer: A
Explanation:
How Resumable Space Allocation Works
The following is an overview of how resumable space allocation works. Details are contained in
later sections.
The ALTER SESSION ENABLE RESUMABLE statement is issued in the session before the
statement executes when the RESUMABLE_TIMEOUT initialization parameter is set to a nonzero
value. The ALTER SESSION ENABLE RESUMABLE TIMEOUT timeout_value statement is
issued in the session before the statement executes, and thetimeout_value is a nonzero value.
Out of space condition Maximum extents reached condition Space quota exceeded condition.
The error is reported in the alert log.
The system issues the Resumable Session Suspended alert.
If the user registered a trigger on the AFTER SUSPEND system event, the user trigger is
executed. A user supplied PL/SQL procedure can access the error message data using the
DBMS_RESUMABLE package and the DBA_ or USER_RESUMABLE view.

Which statement is true regarding the ACL created?
A. It is a list of remote database links stored in the XML file that are available to the users of the
database.
B. It is a list of users and network privileges stored in the XML file according to which a group of
users can connect to one or more hosts.
C. It is a list of users and network privileges stored in the data dictionary according to which a
group of users can connect to one or more hosts.
D. It is the list of the host names or the IP addresses stored in the data dictionary that can connect
to your database through PL/SQL network utility packages such as UTL_TCP.
Answer: B
Explanation:
The DBMS_NETWORK_ACL_ADMIN package provides the interface to administer the network
Access Control List (ACL).
Refer to here for About Fin-Grained Access to External Network Services Configuring fine-grained
access control for users and roles that need to access external network services from the
database. This way, specific groups of users can connect to one or more host computers, based
on privileges that you grant them. Typically, you use this feature to control access to applications
that run on specific host addresses.
To configure fine-grained access control to external network services, you create an access
control list (ACL), which is stored in Oracle XML DB. You can create the access control list by
using Oracle XML DB itself, or by using the DBMS_NETWORK_ACL_ADMIN and
DBMS_NETWORK_ACL_UTILITY PL/SQL packages. This guide explains how to use these
packages to create and manage the access control list. To create an access control list by using
Oracle XML DB and for general conceptual information about access control lists, see Oracle XML

A. An attempt to start a new session by the user belonging to DSS_QUERIES fails with an error
B. A user belonging to DSS_QUERIES can log in to a new session but the session will be queued
C. The CPU_WAIT_TIME column indicates the total time that sessions in the consumer group
waited for the CPU due to resource management
D. The CPU_WAIT_TIME column indicates the total time that sessions in the consumer group
waited for the CPU due to resource management, I/O waits, and latch or enqueue contention
Answer: B,C
Explanation:
V$RSRC_CONSUMER_GROUP Use the V$RSRC_CONSUMER_GROUP view to monitor
resources consumed, including CPU, I/O, and parallel servers. It can also be used to monitor
statistics related to CPU resource management, runaway query management, parallel statement
queuing, and so on. All of the statistics are cumulative from the time when the plan was activated.
SELECT name, active_sessions, queue_length,
consumed_cpu_time, cpu_waits, cpu_wait_time

In the preceding query results, the DSS_QUERIES consumer group has four sessions in its active
session pool and two more sessions queued for activation.
A key measure in this view is CPU_WAIT_TIME. This indicates the total time that sessions in the
consumer group waited for CPU because of resource management. Not included in this measure
are waits due to latch or enqueue contention, I/O waits, and so on.

B. The FILESYSTEMIO_OPTIONS parameter is set to NONE.
C. Another session runs the I/O calibration process concurrently.
D. The pending area has not been created before running the I/O calibration process.
Answer: B
Explanation:
9.1.1.2 FILESYSTEMIO_OPTIONS Initialization Parameter
You can use the FILESYSTEMIO_OPTIONS initialization parameter to enable or disable
asynchronous I/O or direct I/O on file system files. This parameter is platform-specific and has a
default value that is best for a particular platform.
FILESYTEMIO_OPTIONS can be set to one of the following values:
ASYNCH: enable asynchronous I/O on file system files, which has no timing requirement for
transmission.
DIRECTIO: enable direct I/O on file system files, which bypasses the buffer cache.
SETALL: enable both asynchronous and direct I/O on file system files.
NONE: disable both asynchronous and direct I/O on file system files.
To enable asynch I/O, set two values in the init.ora file (or spfile) and recycle the instances:
disk_asynch_io = true
filesystemio_options = asynch
The first one is default; so you may not have to change it. The default of the second one is NONE;
so you will probably have to change it. After setting these values and recycling the instance,

Explanation:
Oracle Database Resource Manager (the Resource Manager) is an infrastructure that provides
granular control of database resources allocated to users, applications, and services. The
Resource Manager solves many resource allocation problems that an operating system does not
manage well, including:
The Resource Manager helps overcome these problems by giving the database more control over
allocation of hardware resources and enabling you to prioritize work within the database. You can
classify sessions into groups based on session attributes, and then allocate resources to these
groups to optimize hardware utilization.

Explanation:
Programs
A program object (program) describes what is to be run by the Scheduler. A program includes:
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 391
A program is a separate entity from a job. A job runs at a certain time or because a certain event
occurred, and invokes a certain program. You can create jobs that point to existing program
objects, which means that different jobs can use the same program and run the program at
different times and with different settings. With the right privileges, different users can use the
same program without having to redefine it. Therefore, you can create program libraries, where
users can select from a list of existing programs.
If a stored procedure or external executable referenced by the program accepts arguments, you
define these arguments in a separate step after creating the program. You can optionally define a
default value for each argument.
Oracle Scheduler
Program objects (programs) contain metadata about the command that the Scheduler will run,
including default values for any arguments. Schedule objects (schedules) contain information
about run date and time and recurrence patterns. Job objects (jobs) associate a program with a
schedule. To define what is executed and when, you assign relationships among programs,
schedules, and jobs.
A job is the combination of a schedule and a program, along with any additional arguments
required by the program.

C. It determines the list of jobs that must be created for each maintenance window.
D. It is spawned by the MMON background process at the start of the maintenance window.
E. It maintains a repository in the SYSTEM tablespace to store the history of the execution of all
tasks.
Answer: B,C,D
Explanation:
AutoTask Overview
Oracle 11g added a new component to the Oracle automated task infrastructure, that began in
Oracle 10g, called AutoTask. AutoTask provides a central component that is responsible for
management of scheduled maintenance tasks.
AutoTask Architecture
AutoTask builds on much of the existing architecture of Oracle 10g. The AutoTask architecture
consists of the following components:
AutoTask Background Process (ABP) - APB is spawned by MMON and is responsible for
managing the AutoTask features. It coordinates the AutoTask clients and the scheduler. It also
maintains AutoTask related history that can be seen in the DBA_AUTOTASK_TASK view.
AutoTask Clients - Automated maintenance tasks that are scheduled by AutoTask. Oracle 11g
includes clients for statistics gathering, the Segment Advisor, and the Automatic SQL Tuning
Advisor.
The AutoTask Maintenance Windows - Individual maintenance windows exist for different days of
the week.
These windows can be modified as required.
Resource Manager - A resource plan is enabled that is designed to limit the amount of resources
that the AutoTask tasks can consume. This resource plan can be modified as required.
OEM - You can manage the start time and duration of the various AutoTask maintenance windows
and add or remove maintenance tasks with OEM. You can also use OEM to enable or disable
maintenance tasks.
The Scheduler - AutoTask operations rely heavily on the Scheduler. The AutoTask architecture
uses scheduler windows and the scheduler infrastructure to execute AutoTask tasks.

(Choose two.)
A. The job is enabled by default after creation
B. The job is automatically dropped after the end date
C. The job executes with the privileges of the user SYS
D. The globalization environment that exists at the time of the job creation prevails at the job runs
Answer: B,C
Explanation:
By default, jobs are created with auto_drop set to TRUE.
end_date
This attribute specifies the date and time after which the job expires and is no longer run. After the
end_date, if auto_drop is TRUE, the job is dropped. If auto_drop is FALSE, the job is disabled and
the STATE of the job is set to COMPLETED.
If no value for end_date is specified, the job repeats forever unless max_runs or max_failures is
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 395
set, in which case the job stops when either value is reached.
The value for end_date must be after the value for start_date. If it is not, an error is generated
when the job is enabled.

You want to schedule a job to rebuild all indexes on the SALES table after the completion of a bulk
load operation.
The bulk load operation must also be a scheduled job that executes as soon as the first file that
contains data arrives on the system.
How would you create these jobs?
A. Create both jobs by using events raised by the scheduler
B. Create both jobs by using events raised by the application
C. Create a job to rebuild indexes by using events raised by the application and then create
another job to perform bulk load by using events raised by the scheduler
D. Create a job to rebuild indexes by using events raised by the Scheduler and then create
another job to perform bulk load by using events raised by the application
Answer: D
Explanation:
The bulk load operation can be done by setting up a file watcher, then raise the event to inform the
scheduler, it is kind of application based event.
After the bulk load job, you can use Scheduler raised event, e.g. JOB COMPLETE, to fire the
index rebuild job.
There are two kinds of events consumed by the Scheduler:
An application can raise an event to be consumed by the Scheduler. The Scheduler reacts to the
event by starting a job. For example, when an inventory tracking system notices that the inventory
has gone below a certain threshold, it can raise an event that starts an inventory replenishment
job.
See "Starting Jobs with Events Raised by Your Application".
You can create a file watcher?a Scheduler object introduced in Oracle Database 11g Release
2?to watch for the arrival of a file on a system. You can then configure a job to start when the file
watcher detects the presence of the file. For example, a data warehouse for a chain of stores
loads data from end-of-day revenue reports uploaded from the point-of-sale systems in the stores.

Which statement is true about a Scheduler-generated event?
A. It can be generated when a file arrives on the file system.
B. it indicates state changes that occur within the Scheduler itself.
C. it is raised by an application that is consumed by the Scheduler to start a job.
D. it requires jobs to be defined with an event condition and a queue specification.
Answer: D
Explanation:
Consuming Job State Events with your Application
To consume job state events, your application must subscribe to the Scheduler event queue
SYS.SCHEDULER$_EVENT_QUEUE. This queue is a secure queue and is owned by SYS. To
create a subscription to this queue for a user, do the following:
1. Log in to the database as the SYS user or as a user with the MANAGE ANY QUEUE privilege.
2. Subscribe to the queue using a new or existing agent.
3. Run the package procedure DBMS_AQADM.ENABLE_DB_ACCESS as follows:
DBMS_AQADM.ENABLE_DB_ACCESS(agent_name, db_username); where agent_name
references the agent that you used to subscribe to the events queue, and db_username is the
user for whom you want to create a subscription.
There is no need to grant dequeue privileges to the user. The dequeue privilege is granted on the
Scheduler event queue to PUBLIC.

QUESTION NO: 664
Which of the following is not a valid calendaring syntax element?
A. FREQ
B. BYHOUR
C. RUNDATE
D. INTERVAL
E. BYMINUTE
Answer: C
Explanation:
Calendaring Syntax (link)
Table 129-10 Values for repeat_interval
FREQ
This specifies the type of recurrence. It must be specified. The possible predefined frequency
values are YEARLY, MONTHLY, WEEKLY, DAILY, HOURLY, MINUTELY, and SECONDLY.
Alternatively, specifies an existing schedule to use as a user-defined frequency.
INTERVAL
This specifies a positive integer representing how often the recurrence repeats. The default is 1,
which means every second for secondly, every day for daily, and so on. The maximum value is 99.
BYMONTH
This specifies which month or months you want the job to execute in. You can use numbers such
as 1 for January and 3 for March, as well as three-letter abbreviations such as FEB for February
and JUL for July.
BYWEEKNO
This specifies the week of the year as a number. It follows ISO-8601, which defines the week as
starting with Monday and ending with Sunday; and the first week of a year as the first week, which
is mostly within the Gregorian year. The first week is equivalent to the following two variants: the
week that contains the first Thursday of the Gregorian year; and the week containing January 4th.
The ISO-8601 week numbers are integers from 1 to 52 or 53; parts of week 1 may be in the
previous calendar year; parts of week 52 may be in the following calendar year; and if a year has a
week 53, parts of it must be in the following calendar year.
As an example, in the year 1998, the ISO week 1 began on Monday December 29th, 1997; and
the last ISO week (week 53) ended on Sunday January 3rd, 1999. So December 29th, 1997, is in
the ISO week 1998-01, and January 1st, 1999, is in the ISO week 1998-53.
byweekno is only valid for YEARLY. Examples of invalid specifications are "FREQ=YEARLY;
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 400
BYWEEKNO=1; BYMONTH=12" and "FREQ=YEARLY; BYWEEKNO=53;BYMONTH=1".
BYYEARDAY
This specifies the day of the year as a number. Valid values are 1 to 366. An example is 69, which
is March 10 (31 for January, 28 for February, and 10 for March). 69 evaluates to March 10 for nonleap
years and March 9 in leap years. -2 will always evaluate to December 30th independent of
whether it is a leap year.
BYDATE
This specifies a list of dates, where each date is of the form [YYYY] MMDD. A list of consecutive
dates can be generated by using the SPAN modifier, and a date can be adjusted with the OFFSET
modifier. An example of a simple BYDATE clause follows:
BYDATE=0115,0315,0615,0915,1215,20060115 The following SPAN example is equivalent to
BYDATE=0110,0111,0112,0113,0114, which is a span of 5 days starting at 1/10:
BYDATE=0110+SPAN:5D
The plus sign in front of the SPAN keyword indicates a span starting at the supplied date. The
minus sign indicates a span ending at the supplied date, and the "^" sign indicates a span of n
days or weeks centered around the supplied date. If n is an even number, it is adjusted up to the
next odd number.
Offsets adjust the supplied date by adding or subtracting n days or weeks. BYDATE=0205-
OFFSET: 2W is equivalent to BYDATE=0205-14D (the OFFSET: keyword is optional), which is
also equivalent to BYDATE=0122.
BYMONTHDAY
This specifies the day of the month as a number. Valid values are 1 to 31. An example is 10,
which means the 10th day of the selected month. You can use the minus sign (-) to count
backward from the last day, so, for example, BYMONTHDAY=-1 means the last day of the month
and BYMONTHDAY=-2 means the next to last day of the month.
BYDAY
This specifies the day of the week from Monday to Sunday in the form MON, TUE, and so on.
Using numbers, you can specify the 26th Friday of the year, if using a YEARLY frequency, or the
4th THU of the month, using a MONTHLY frequency. Using the minus sign, you can say the
second to last Friday of the month. For example, -1 FRI is the last Friday of the month.
BYHOUR
This specifies the hour on which the job is to run. Valid values are 0 to 23. As an example, 10
means 10 a.m.
BYMINUTE
This specifies the minute on which the job is to run. Valid values are 0 to 59. As an example, 45
means 45 minutes past the chosen hour.
BYSECOND
This specifies the second on which the job is to run. Valid values are 0 to 59. As an example, 30
means 30 seconds past the chosen minute.
BYSETPOS
This selects one or more items, by position, in the list of timestamps that result after the whole
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 401
calendaring expression is evaluated. It is useful for requirements such as running a job on the last
workday of the month. Rather than attempting to express this with the other BY clauses, you can
code the calendaring expression to evaluate to a list of every workday of the month, and then add
the BYSETPOS clause to select only the last item of that list. Assuming that workdays are Monday
through Friday, the syntax would then be:
FREQ=MONTHLY; BYDAY=MON,TUE,WED,THU,FRI; BYSETPOS=-1
Valid values are 1 through 9999. A negative number selects an item from the end of the list (-1 is
the last item, -2 is the next to last item, and so on) and a positive number selects from the front of
the list. The BYSETPOS clause is always evaluated last. BYSETPOS is only supported with the
MONTHLY and YEARLY frequencies. The BYSETPOS clause is applied to the list of timestamps
once per frequency period. For example, when the frequency is defined as MONTHLY, the
Scheduler determines all valid timestamps for the month, orders that list, and then applies the
BYSETPOS clause. The Scheduler then moves on to the next month and repeats the procedure.
Assuming a start date of Jun 10, 2004, the example evaluates to: Jun 30, Jul 30, Aug 31, Sep 30,
Oct 29, and so on.
INCLUDE
This includes one or more named schedules in the calendaring expression. That is, the set of
timestamps defined by each included named schedule is added to the results of the calendaring
expression. If an identical timestamp is contributed by both an included schedule and the
calendaring expression, it is included in the resulting set of timestamps only once. The named
schedules must have been defined with the CREATE_SCHEDULE procedure.
EXCLUDE
This excludes one or more named schedules from the calendaring expression. That is, the set of
timestamps defined by each excluded named schedule is removed from the results of the
calendaring expression. The named schedules must have been defined with the
CREATE_SCHEDULE procedure.
INTERSECT
This specifies an intersection between the calendaring expression results and the set of
timestamps defined by one or more named schedules. Only the timestamps that appear both in
the calendaring expression and in one of the named schedules are included in the resulting set of
timestamps. For example, assume that the named schedule last_sat indicates the last Saturday in
every month, and that for the year 2005, the only months where the last day of the month is also a
Saturday are April and December.
Assume also that the named schedule end_qtr indicates the last day of each quarter in 2005:
3/31/2005, 6/30/2005, 9/30/2005, 12/31/2005 These calendaring expressions result in the dates
that follow:
3/31/2005, 4/30/2005, 6/30/2005, 9/30/2005, 12/31/2005
FREQ=MONTHLY; BYMONTHDAY=-1; INTERSECT=last_sat,end_qtr
In this example, the terms FREQ=MONTHLY; BYMONTHDAY=-1 indicate the last day of each
month.
PERIODS
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 402
This identifies the number of periods that together form one cycle of a user-defined frequency. It is
used in the repeat_interval expression of the schedule that defines the user-defined frequency. It
is mandatory when the repeat_interval expression in the main schedule contains a BYPERIOD
clause. The following example defines the quarters of a fiscal year.
FREQ=YEARLY;BYDATE=0301,0601,0901,1201;PERIODS=4
BYPERIOD
This selects periods from a user-defined frequency. For example, if a main schedule names a
user-defined frequency schedule that defines the fiscal quarters shown in the previous example,
the clause BYPERIOD=2,4 in the main schedule selects the 2nd and 4th fiscal quarters.

Answer: A,D
Explanation: ----------------------------------------------
Attributes list of SET_SCHEDULE_ATTRIBUTE:
'default_timezone': Repeating jobs and windows that use the calendaring syntax retrieve the time
zone from this attribute when start_date is not specified. See "Calendaring Syntax" for more
information.
'email_server': The SMTP server address that the Scheduler uses to send e-mail notifications for
job state events. E-mail notifications cannot be sent if this attribute is NULL.
'email_sender': The default e-mail address of the sender of job state e-mail notifications.
'email_server_credential': The schema and name of an existing credential object that SYS has
execute object privileges on. Default is NULL. The username and password stored in this
credential are used to authenticate with the e-mail server when sending e-mail notifications. This
functionality is available with Oracle Database 11g Release 2 (11.2.0.2).
'email_server_encryption': This attribute indicates whether or not encryption is enabled for this
email server connection, and if so, at what point encryption starts, and with which protocol. This
functionality is available starting with Oracle Database 11g Release 2 (11.2.0.2). Values are:
NONE: the default, indicating no encryption used
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 404
SSL_TLS: indicating that either SSL or TLS are used, from the beginning of the connection
STARTTLS:indicating that the connection starts unencrypted, but the command STARTTLS is

'event_expiry_time': The time, in seconds, before a job state event generated by the Scheduler
expires from the Scheduler event queue. If NULL, job state events expire after 24 hours.
'log_history': The number of days that log entries for both the job log and the window log are
retained. Default is 30 and the range of valid values is 0 through 1000000.
'max_job_slave_processes': This Scheduler attribute is not used.
The PURGE_LOG Procedure uses "WHICH_LOG" and "LOG_NAME" attributes.
Syntax
Parameters
log_history
This specifies how much history (in days) to keep. The valid range is 0 - 1000000. If set to 0, no
history is kept.
which_log
This specifies the log type. Valid values are: job_log, window_log, and job_and_window_log.
job_name
This specifies which job-specific entries must be purged from the jog log. This can be a commadelimited
list of job names and job classes. Whenever job_name has a value other than NULL, the
which_log argument implicitly includes the job log.
QUESTION NO: 668
Consider the following code snippet:
Oracle 1z0-053 Exam
"Pass Any Exam. Any Time." - www.actualtests.com 405
If this code were executed, which of the following statements would be true?
A. The priority of the lne_job1 job would be set to 1.
B. The lne_job1 job would be executed synchronously.
C. The lne_job1 job would run immediately in the users current session.
D. The lne_job1 job would retain its current priority.
E. The job will immediately take priority over all running jobs.
Answer: A
Explanation:
job_priority
This attribute specifies the priority of this job relative to other jobs in the same class as this job. If
multiple jobs within a class are scheduled to be executed at the same time, the job priority
determines the order in which jobs from that class are picked up for execution by the job
coordinator. It can be a value from 1 through 5, with 1 being the first to be picked up for job
execution.
If no job priority is specified when creating a job, the default priority of 3 is assigned to it.

TRUE and the value of the CASCADE attribute is TRUE.
E. The STATE column of the job table will be set to COMPLETED for the job.
Answer: A,B,C
Explanation:
auto_drop, If TRUE (the default), indicates that the job should be dropped once completed.
end_date, This attribute specifies the date and time after which the job expires and is no longer
run. After the end_date, if auto_drop is TRUE, the job is dropped. If auto_drop is FALSE, the job is
disabled and the STATE of the job is set to COMPLETED.
If no value for end_date is specified, the job repeats forever unless max_runs or max_failures is
set, in which case the job stops when either value is reached. The value for end_date must be
after the value for start_date. If it is not, an error is generated when the job is enabled.

Which NLS parameter can be used to change the default Oracle sort method from binary to
linguistic for the SQL SELECT statement?
A. NLS_LANG
B. NLS_COMP
C. NLS_SORT
D. None of the above
Answer: D
Explanation:
Neither NLS_SORT nor NLS_COMP cannot change sorting from BINARY to LINGUISTIC.
Because the NLS_SORT depends on NLS_COMP, if they are different, the sorting method will
always be BINARY.
(Refer to NLS_SORT) The exact operators and query clauses that obey the NLS_SORT
parameter depend on the value of the NLS_COMP parameter. If an operator or clause does not
obey the NLS_SORT value, as determined by NLS_COMP, the collation used is BINARY.
The BINARY comparison is faster and uses less resources than any linguistic comparison but for
text in a natural language, it does not provide ordering expected by users.
The value of NLS_SORT affects execution plans of queries. Because a standard index cannot be
used as a source of values sorted in a linguistic order, an explicit sort operation must usually be
performed instead of an index range scan. A functional index on the NLSSORT function may be
defined to provide values sorted in a linguistic order and reintroduce the index range scan to the
execution plan.
NLS_COMP specifies the collation behavior of the database session.
